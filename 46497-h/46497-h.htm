<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The Studies contained in the following pages were, in
the first instance, undertaken some four or five years ago.
From time to time the exigencies of other literary work
have compelled me to lay them aside, but the subject
has never been lost sight of, and, not infrequently, studies
in appearance wholly unconnected with the <i>Lancelot</i> legend
have thrown an unexpected and welcome light on certain
points of the story. Undertaken, in the first instance, with
an absolutely open mind (even after I had been working
at it for two or three years I should have been sorely at a
loss if asked to state a theory of the origin of the story),
it was only by slow degrees that the real bearing of the
evidence became clear, and I felt that I had at last grasped
a guiding thread through the perplexing maze. The results,
which perhaps to some readers may appear startlingly
subversive of opinions formally expressed by certain distinguished
scholars, were wholly unforeseen. They are the
outcome of genuine study of original texts; whether, in the
long-run they be, or be not generally accepted, I would at
least plead that they be judged <i>on the evidence of those texts</i>.</p>

<p>In certain cases I have little doubt as to the verdict.
So far as the evidence concerning the sources of Malory,
and the differing versions of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, is concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
the facts, now brought forward for the first time, are
beyond dispute. They may, I hope they will, be hereafter
added to, and confirmed. As they stand they encourage us
to hope that further study of the material already available
may yield welcome, and perhaps unsuspected results.</p>

<p>We are, so far, only on the threshold of a satisfactory
and scientific criticism of the Arthurian cycle, and I
doubt whether all who are engaged in this study recognise
sufficiently either the extent and complexity of
the questions involved, or the absolute futility of, at this
early stage, enunciating dogmatic decisions on any of the
various points at issue. Is there any one living scholar
who is perfectly aware of <i>all</i> the evidence at our disposal
for any of the great stories of the cycle? If there be,
he will know, better than any other, that till critical
editions place us in a position to determine the characteristic
readings of the <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> representing not one alone, but
<i>all</i> those stories, their inter-relation, their points of contact
with, and variance from each other, the very best work
that can be done will be liable to bear the impress of
a temporary character&mdash;it will not, it cannot be, final.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, I have urged that this fact be recognised and
acted upon, and I cannot but hope that the evidence
collected in these studies may help to convince others of
the real necessity for a determined effort to edit and render
accessible the principal Arthurian texts, and the certain
and permanent profit likely to result from such a work.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large">THE LEGEND OF</span><br />
<span class="xl">SIR LANCELOT DU LAC</span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTORY</p>


<p>To the great majority of English readers, those who are
familiar with the Arthurian legend through the pages of
Malory and Tennyson, the name which occurs most
readily to their minds in connection with the court and
Table of King Arthur is that of Lancelot du Lac, at once
the most gallant servant of the king, and the secret lover
of the queen. To many the story of Lancelot and
Guinevere is the most famous of all stories of unlawful
love.</p>

<p>True, of late years the popularity of Wagner's music has
made their ears, at least, familiar with the names of Tristan
and Iseult. Still, that Tristan and Iseult were ever as
famous as Lancelot and Guinevere, few outside the ranks
of professed students of mediæval literature would believe;
still fewer admit that the loves of Arthur's queen and
Arthur's knight were suggested by, if not imitated from,
the older, more poetic, and infinitely more convincing,
Celtic love-tale; that Lancelot, as Arthur's knight and
Guinevere's lover, is a comparatively late addition to the
Arthurian legend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet so it is. I doubt if any scholar of standing would
now argue that Lancelot and his relation to the queen
formed an integral portion of the early tradition; if any,
conversant with the literature of the cycle, would reckon
Lancelot among the original band of heroes who gathered
round the British king.</p>

<p>In the introduction to my studies on the Gawain
legend, I remarked that, if we desired to arrive at an
elucidation of the Arthurian problem as a whole, we must
first begin with the elucidation of its component parts&mdash;we
must severally disentangle the legends connected with the
leading knights of the cycle before we can hope to understand
the growth and development of that cycle. When
we have arrived at some clear idea concerning the stories
originally told of the Arthurian heroes, and their relation
to each other and to the king, we shall then be in a better
position to judge of the nature of the original legend&mdash;whether
it be mainly the product of literary invention,
or in its more important features, the work of mythical
tradition. It is not a matter of slight importance to ascertain
to which of these two categories the leading heroes of
Arthurian romance belong.</p>

<p>In the case of Sir Gawain we were able to detect
certain features which, by their persistent recurrence in
the great mass of tradition connected with this knight,
seemed to indicate a general recognition on the part of the
romance writers that they belonged to an early form of
his story, and as such were to be preserved even when
but incompletely understood. Further I pointed out the
parallels existing between certain of his most famous
adventures and those recorded in early Irish tradition,
parallels which went far to prove, not merely the antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of the feats ascribed to him, but their source in Celtic
myth.</p>

<p>In the following studies I shall endeavour, in the same
way, to trace to its origin the legend of Lancelot du Lac,
to discover what was the tale originally connected with
him, and, if possible, follow the steps which led to the
immense development of his popularity. I do not for a
moment suggest, any more than in the case of Gawain, the
finality of the results arrived at; but I hope at least to
present the reader with a sorely needed summary of the
Lancelot legend, and to clear the ground for further
researches into his story.</p>

<p>In some ways the task before us is less difficult than
that involved in the examination of the Gawain legend;
the literature connected with Lancelot, if extensive, is not
diffuse; by far the greater portion is covered by the prose
<i>Lancelot</i> and the Grail Romances. On the other hand
the story, as compared with that of Gawain, is extraordinarily
deficient in characteristic features. The adventures
ascribed to Lancelot might just as well be placed to the
credit of any other knight: they are the ordinary stock-in-trade
of the mediæval romancer. Guinevere's lover he is,
but the love-story is of the most conventional character:
the more it is studied the more clearly do the records in
which it is shrined appear the offspring of conscious
literary invention, and that invention of by no means a
high order. He is certainly no hero of prehistoric myth,
solar or otherwise, as Gawain or Perceval may well be;
nor does he by force of sheer humanity lay hold on our
imagination, as does Tristan.</p>

<p>How then did Lancelot come into the Arthurian cycle?
In the earliest records of Arthurian legend he holds no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
place. Wace's <i>Brut</i>, the French metrical version of the
History of Geoffrey of Monmouth, written about the
middle of the twelfth century, gives the names of certain
of Arthur's knights, Gawain, Kay, Bedivere, Iwein, but
never mentions Lancelot. We have an account of Arthur's
expedition to France, in the course of which he slew
Frollo outside the walls of Paris, an adventure which the
compiler of the Prose <i>Lancelot</i> places during the war
against Claudas to recover Lancelot's patrimony, but in
the <i>Brut</i> this expedition takes place at an early stage in
Arthur's reign, and knows nothing of Lancelot or Claudas.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Dating apparently from the same period, the middle of
the twelfth century, is a bas-relief of the cathedral of
Modena, representing a female figure standing on the
summit of a tower, towards which several armed knights
are approaching. Each knight is named, and we find
represented Arthur himself, Gawain, Kay, Ider, Carados,
and a certain Galuariun, who has not been identified.
Lancelot is not among them.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Welsh Arthurian stories again know nothing of
Lancelot, though certain of them contain long lists of
heroes of Arthur's court.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>So far as we can at present tell, the earliest mention of
the knight is that contained in the <i>Erec</i> of Chrétien de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Troyes, where in a long list of the heroes of the Round
Table, ranged according to merit (at least in the case of
the earlier names), Lanceloz del Lac is reckoned third,
the first two being Gawain and Erec.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the German
version by Hartmann von Aue, he occupies the same
place, but is called Lanzelot von Arlac. Nothing more
is related of him: he plays no rôle in the story, he is a
name, and nought else. In a later poem by Chrétien,
<i>Cligés</i>, the same position, third on the roll of heroes, is
ascribed to Lancelot, but here it is Perceval, and not Erec,
who ranks second. The hero of the poem, Cligés, appears
at a tournament four successive days, in different armour,
and overthrows Segramor, Lancelot, and Perceval, finally
fighting an undecided combat with Gawain.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The <i>Cligés</i>
reference is particularly noticeable, as the <i>motif</i> of the
story is the love of the hero for the young wife of his uncle
and sovereign. In this connection the loves of Tristan
and Iseult are often referred to, but Lancelot and
Guinevere never. It seems clear that when Chrétien
wrote this poem he did not know Lancelot as the lover of
Arthur's queen and the chief of Arthur's knights.</p>

<p>But in the poem which followed the <i>Cligés</i>, <i>Le Chevalier
de la Charrette</i>, Lancelot suddenly appears in both these
characters, Gawain's superior and the lover of Guinevere:
no explanation of the changed position is offered, but
Chrétien takes for granted the familiarity of his audience
with the relations between the knight and the queen. To
add to the confusion, in the succeeding poem <i>Le Chevalier
au Lion</i>, Lancelot is only once referred to, in connection
with the <i>Charrette</i> adventure, and is never mentioned as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
one of the knights of Arthurs household; while in
Chrétien's last poem, the <i>Perceval</i>, he is altogether
ignored.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is very difficult, indeed impossible, to date Chrétien's
poems with exactness. The only two which afford clear
internal evidence on the point, <i>Le Chevalier de la Charrette</i>
and <i>Le Chevalier au Lion</i>, fall within the years 1164-1173.
<i>Erec</i> was the first of his Arthurian poems, and between
<i>Erec</i> and the <i>Charrette</i>, certainly one work, <i>Cligés</i>, and it
may be several, intervened.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Very probably the <i>Erec</i> was written early in the decade,
1150-60, and taken in conjunction with the negative
evidence afforded by the <i>Brut</i> and the Italian bas-relief, it
goes to prove that whereas the name of Gawain, as
connected with Arthur, was known by the end of the
eleventh century,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Arthurian tradition knew nothing of
Lancelot till the latter half of the twelfth; and that no
mention of his relations with Guinevere is found till
between 1160-1170, that is, a decade after the first mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of his name. It is, of course, a well-recognised fact in the
study of romance, that the date of a manuscript does not
fix the date of the story contained in it; a younger manuscript
may contain the same story under an older form. As
a rule, the versions contained in Chrétien's poems appear
to present a fairly old form of the stories they relate, saving
in the case of Lancelot. About this knight, Chrétien
either knows nothing or he knows too much. The earlier
stages of his story he leaves unrecorded; yet an allusion in
the <i>Charrette</i> poem<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> shows that he was not unacquainted
with the legend concerning his youth and upbringing. Two
versions of this legend have been preserved to us, one in
verse and one in prose. In the following chapter we will
examine the older of these versions, and inquire into the
origin of our hero's name.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">THE 'LANZELET' OF ULRICH VON ZATZIKHOVEN</p>


<p>The origin of the name <i>Lancelot</i> has been a subject of
considerable debate among scholars, and has given rise
to the most widely differing explanations. M. de la Villemarqué,
who was a warm advocate of the Welsh origin of
the Arthurian stories, derived the name from the French
<i>l'ancelot</i>, a youth or servant, which he held to be a translation
of the Welsh Melwas, or Maelwas. This solution
was rejected by M. Gaston Paris, in his study on the
Lancelot poems,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in which he showed that <i>ancelot</i> was
not a French common name, and that Maelwas did not
bear the signification attributed to it. Professor Rhys,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
adopting the theory of the Welsh origin of the name,
which in its present form he admitted only exists in
Welsh literature as borrowed from French or English
sources, decided that it represented a Welsh variant of
Peredur, the root of this latter name being <i>Pâr</i>=<i>a spear
or lance</i>. 'The characters,' says Professor Rhys, 'were
originally the same, though their respective developments
eventually differed very widely.' I doubt if this solution
ever found any adherents except its author: it is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to remark that the derivation of Peredur, on which it rests,
is by no means universally accepted, and that Lancelot is
in no special way connected with a spear or lance.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is
certainly true that the Lancelot story shows signs of having
been affected by the Perceval legend, but as we shall see
the borrowings are restricted to one special and purely
continental form of the story.</p>

<p>M. Gaston Paris, in the study referred to above, suggested
that Lancelot might be either a Celtic name altered, or,
more probably, the substitution, by French poets, of a
name of Germanic origin for one of Breton form strange
to the ears of their French audiences, <i>e.g.</i> it might be a
diminutive form of <i>Lanzo</i>. This is also the conclusion of
Professor Zimmer.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The prefix <i>Lant</i> is often found in
names of Frankish origin transferred to Breton ground:
such names are Lando, Landolin; Lanzo, Lanzolin, etc.</p>

<p>In the introduction to his edition of the <i>Charrette</i>,
recently published,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Professor Foerster announces his
complete adhesion to this view.</p>

<p>It certainly seems that the evidence points strongly to
this conclusion. The fact that Lancelot's name does not
appear in the earliest obtainable Arthurian documents
shows that he did not belong to the original 'stoff' of the
cycle; the entire silence of Welsh literature, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
practical silence of English vernacular romances,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> seem
to show that he formed no part of the <i>insular</i> Arthurian
tradition. For my own part I unhesitatingly accept Professor
Foerster's dictum, '<i>Lancelot ist den Kymren gänzlich
unbekannt, und ist unter allen Umständen Kontinentaler<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Herkunft</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A weak point in the proposed Celtic solutions appears
to me to be that both entirely ignore the qualifying title
<i>du Lac</i>, by which Lancelot is invariably known. Neither
M. de la Villemarqué nor Professor Rhys appear to consider
it of any special importance, yet if I mistake not this
is just the significant point of the Lancelot story, and that
which from the very outset differentiates it from the legends
connected with Peredur or Maelwas. From the moment
of his appearance in Chrétien's list of Arthur's knights to
that in which the prose <i>Lancelot</i> records his death in the
odour of sanctity, Lancelot is Lancelot <i>du Lac</i>, and the
earliest version of his story which we possess amply justifies
his claim to the title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The poem of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is certainly later
than either the <i>Erec</i> or the <i>Charrette</i> of Chrétien, but the
tradition it embodies is anterior to the poem itself. Written
in the opening years of the thirteenth century, it is, as
explicitly stated in the text, the translation of '<i>daz welsche
buoch von Lanzelete</i>,' brought to Germany by Hugo de
Morville, one of the hostages who in 1194 replaced Richard
of England in the prison of Leopold of Austria.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
date of the original French version cannot, of course, be
fixed. In any case it must have preceded its introduction
into Germany; judging from internal evidence it represented
an early and immature version of the Lancelot
legend. The story as related in the <i>Lanzelet</i> is as follows:
Lanzelet was son to King Pant of Genewîs and his wife
Clarine. By a revolt of his people Pant was driven from
his kingdom with his wife and child. In his flight he came
to a stream, and there, overcome by his wounds, sank
down and died. The queen had laid her child under a
tree while she tended her husband, and before she could
reach it again a water-fairy (<i>mer-feine</i>) came in a cloud of
mist and carried off the infant. The fairy was a queen,
ruling over ten thousand maidens, who knew no man. Her
kingdom was called <i>Meide-lant</i>; there it was ever May-tide,
and her palace had such virtue that whoso abode one day
within it might never know sorrow till the day of his death.
There the little Lanzelet was brought up, in ignorance of
his name and rank, till he reached the age of fifteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
knowing nothing of knighthood, nor even how to bestride
a horse. Then eager to try his lot in the world outside
he demanded leave to ride forth. This the fairy granted,
but refused to tell him his name and parentage; he must
first conquer the strongest knight in the world, Iweret, of
the fair wood Beforet.</p>

<p>She gave him rich armour, white as a swan, the best that
might be, a surcoat (<i>wafen-roc</i>) decked with golden bells;
sword and shield, and a goodly horse. But the lad did
not know how to ride, so let the bridle hang loose and
held on by the saddle-bow. In this fashion he rode till
he met a knight, Johfrit de Liez, who rebuked him for his
childish bearing, and took him to his castle, where he was
kindly welcomed by the host's mother and her maidens,
and instructed in riding and the use of knightly weapons.</p>

<p>His next adventure is to ride with two knights to the
castle of one Galagandreiz. In the night the daughter of
the host, condemned by her father to perpetual virginity,
offers her love to the three knights in turn; is accepted by
Lanzelet, who fights a duel with her father, slays him,
and weds the maiden. One day he rode forth seeking
adventures, and found a road which led him to the castle
of Limors. The folk attacked, and would have slain him,
but for the intervention of Ade, niece to the lord of the
castle. Lanzelet is thrown into prison, and only escapes
by fighting single-handed, first with a giant, then with two
lions, and finally with the lord of the castle himself. Having
slain this last, he becomes the '<i>ami</i>' of the maiden Ade.
(Whether he marries her or not is not clearly stated. In
any case we hear no more of his first wife, the daughter of
Galagandreiz.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fame of Lanzelet's exploits has penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to Arthur's ears, and Gawain is sent to find the unnamed
hero, and bring him to Arthur's Court. They meet, and
fight an undecided combat, terminated by the arrival of a
messenger with tidings of a tournament between King Lot
of Johenîs and Gurnemanz, <i>den fürsten wîs</i>. Lanzelet
betakes himself hither, wearing each day a different suit
of armour, green, red and white, overthrows many knights,
including King Lot, whom he set free out of friendship for
Gawain, and without revealing himself, rides away with
Ade and her brother.</p>

<p>They come to a castle, Schâtel le Mort, the master of
which, Mâbûz, is a magician, and son to the fairy who had
brought Lanzelet up. Lanzelet rides to the castle, which
has this property, that whoever crosses its drawbridge at
once loses all courage and hardihood. Lanzelet falls under
the spell, and is taken prisoner in the most ignominious
manner, much to the dismay of Ade, who rides off with
her brother and disappears from the story. The land of
Mâbûz adjoins that of Iweret of Beforet, who is in the habit
of raiding his neighbour's territory. Mâbûz, who is by
nature a coward, determines that Lanzelet, whose fame is
well known to him, shall be his champion. He has him
carried by his men without the walls of the castle, when
his natural courage at once returns. He rides to a fountain,
beside which hangs a brazen cymbal on which he must
strike three times with a hammer to summon his foe. In
the meantime Iblîs, the fair daughter of Iweret, has had a
dream of an unknown knight whom she meets beside the
fountain; she rises early to seek the scene of her dream,
and finds the original of her vision in Lanzelet. She
beseeches him to carry her off without waiting for the
conflict, but Lanzelet refuses. Iweret arrives and a fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
fight ensues, in which he is slain. Lanzelet weds Iblîs and
becomes master of Beforet.</p>

<p>A messenger now arrives from the Fairy of the Lake,
revealing Lanzelet's name and parentage (his mother,
Clarine, was sister to Arthur). The object of her theft of
the child is now accomplished: she desired to secure a
champion who would free her son Mâbûz from his too
powerful enemy. Lanzelet decides to seek Gawain, whom
he now knows to be his kinsman. On their way they meet
a squire who informs them that the King Valerîn (or
Falerîn, the spelling varies), has appeared at Arthur's
court and laid claim to Guinevere, on the ground that she
had been betrothed to him previous to her marriage with
Arthur. If Valerîn cannot find a champion to oppose him
he will carry off the queen. Lanzelet undertakes the
combat, and defeats Valerîn.</p>

<p>(We must note here that Lanzelet's service to the queen
is of a <i>preventive</i> character, <i>i.e.</i> he saves her from the
possibility of abduction, he does not rescue her after the
abduction has taken place.)</p>

<p>Lanzelet then leaves his wife at court, and goes forth to
seek the castle of Plurîs, which he had passed on his
journey from <i>Meide-land</i> and the adventure of which he
desires to test. There he is challenged by one hundred
knights, whom he successively overthrows, and weds the
queen (Ulrich says quaintly, '<i>ich enweiz ob erz ungerne tet,
wan diu königîn was ein sch&oelig;ne maget</i>, 5530-1). Iblîs
remains at Arthur's court, grieving for the disappearance of
her husband, during whose absence she successfully withstands
the <i>Mantle</i> test, an incident of not infrequent
occurrence in Arthurian romance.</p>

<p>Hearing that Lanzelet is a prisoner at Plurîs, Gawain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Karjet (Gaheriet?), Erec, and Tristan go in search of him,
and, by means of a ruse, succeed in freeing him. The
queen of Plurîs disappears from the story.</p>

<p><i>On their way to court they learn that, while engaged in hunting
the white stag, Guinevere has been carried off by Valerîn,
and imprisoned in a magic castle, surrounded by a dense
thicket peopled with all kinds of serpents. Tristan, 'der listige
Tristan'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> suggests that they should seek the aid of Malduz<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
or Malduc, the magician, the Lord of the Misty Lake
(Genibeleten Se), who will enable them to penetrate Valerîn's
stronghold. Erec announces that neither he nor Gawain
should take part in the expedition as they have respectively
slain Malduc's father and brother. Arthur therefore sets
forth accompanied by Karjet (Gaheriet), Tristan and
Lanzelet (this is the order), and are later joined by Dodine
le Sauvage. By the good offices of the enchanter's daughter,
to whom Arthur appeals, Malduc consents to aid them on
condition that Erec and Gawain are delivered up to him, to
which these heroes willingly consent. Malduc then, by means
of spells, disperses the serpents guarding Valerîn's castle,
slays him and his men, and wakens Guinevere from the
magic slumber into which Valerîn has cast her.</i></p>

<p>I have italicised this passage as extremely important for
the criticism of the story. It will be seen that so far from
Lanzelet being the means of Guinevere's escape, he plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
practically no part in the story, all he does is to accompany
the king. The rescuer is Malduc; recourse to him
is suggested by Tristan and made possible by the self-sacrifice
of Gawain and Erec; but saving in the discussion
as to whether Malduc's terms shall or shall not be accepted,
Lanzelet's name is not even mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Erec and Gawain are cast into prison by Malduc and
nearly starved to death, but are rescued by one hundred
of Arthur's knights, headed by Lanzelet and aided by
a giant, Esealt der lange. They all return to Arthur's
court, where great feasts are held.</p>

<p>Iblîs tells her husband of a curious adventure which had
befallen one of the knights: how he had met in a forest
a terrible dragon which, speaking with a human voice, besought
a kiss from the knight; he refused and the dragon
flew away lamenting. Lanzelet resolves to test the adventure,
rides to the forest, finds the dragon, and gives the
desired kiss. The monster bathes in a stream at hand,
and becomes a fair maiden, Elidiâ, daughter to the king of
Thile; she has been transformed into a dragon for trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>gressing
the rules of <i>Minne</i>, and condemned to remain in
that form till kissed by the best knight on earth. She
remains at Arthur's court, where she is made judge of
all disputed questions relating to <i>Minne</i>.</p>

<p>Here the story of Lanzelet practically ends. He wins
back his lands of Genewîs without difficulty, promising to
treat his subjects better than his father did. He and
Iblîs betake themselves to the heritage of the latter,
Beforet, where they receive Arthur and Guinevere with
great pomp. The poem concludes by telling us that they
have four children, three sons and one daughter, that they
live to see their children's children, and die both on the
same day.</p>

<p>The poem of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven has scarcely received
the attention which, as a factor in the criticism of
the legend, it undoubtedly demands. The questions arising
out of it are not only interesting, but, as I shall presently
show, in one instance at least, of the very highest importance.
The questions may be grouped as (<i>a</i>) those
relating to the structure and sources of the poem itself;
(<i>b</i>) those which affect its relation to the other Lancelot
romances. For the first it is obvious that we are dealing
with a poem of very loose construction; the various parts
do not harmonise with each other, and no attempt has
been made to make them do so. Thus we have no fewer
than four love affairs attributed to Lanzelet, and in three
out of the four he weds the lady; yet these amours, one
of which is subsequent to his marriage with Iblîs, are
dropped as of no account. Professor Foerster<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> considers
that this looseness of construction points to a late date,
and that the source of the <i>Lanzelet</i> was a biographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
romance of the weakest order. According to Professor
Foerster the clearer the composition, the better knit the
incidents, the older the romance.</p>

<p>Now it seems to me that there are two orders of ill-constructed
romances, and that we shall do well to differentiate
between them. In one case we have a number of incidents
of secondary character, obviously borrowed or
imitated from those occurring elsewhere, strung together
more or less cleverly on the thread of a hero's individuality.
The incidents are all to be found in other romances, and
as a rule none of them have any suggestion of Celtic or
mythic origin. The literary style is superior to the matter.
Such romances are <i>e.g.</i> <i>Rigomer</i>, <i>Torec</i>, <i>Le Chevalier à la
Manche</i>. A very favourable example is <i>Méraugis de
Portlesguez</i>. These are all certainly late romances.</p>

<p>In the other case we have a romance even more ill-constructed,
but consisting not of incidents but of whole
short tales, manifestly independent of each other, and
some of them of distinctly antique and mythic character:
the literary style is poor and the whole is less a romance,
properly speaking, than the material out of which a
romance can be evolved. This, I believe, marks an early
stage of development, and of this we have naturally but
few specimens. The <i>Lanzelet</i> is, I believe, one.</p>

<p>If I mistake not, the groundwork is a series of <i>lais</i>,
each complete in itself, and having no connection with
what precedes or what follows it. It is in no real sense a
biographical romance, though perhaps it might be called
a tentative effort in that direction. The <i>Mantle</i> episode
certainly formed a single <i>lai</i>; the <i>Fier Baiser</i>, now found
with other adventures, probably originally did so.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of the episodes, too, possess a distinctly archaic character,
<i>e.g.</i> the description of the fairy's kingdom as a isle of
women where no man penetrates, a conception much older
than the <i>Fata Morgana</i> of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>; and the
description of Guinevere's prison, the magic slumber in a
fair dwelling, <i>ein wünneclichez haus</i>, surrounded by a dense
thicket infested with serpents, is the sleeping beauty story
in its oldest 'other world' form.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The position of Gawain
in the story is that held by him in the earlier, pre-Lancelot
romances.</p>

<p>I cannot accept the suggestion of a biographical <i>Lancelot</i>
from which both the <i>Lanzelet</i> and the <i>Charrette</i> were
drawn. If we remember that the first mention of Lancelot
in Arthurian romance can only be traced to the second
half of the twelfth century, it does not seem probable that
by 1164 (when, or about when, Chrétien wrote his poem) he
could have become the hero of a fixed biographical romance.
Nor, the <i>motif</i> of his <i>liaison</i> with Guinevere once introduced
into the story, is the compilation of such a
version as the <i>Lanzelet</i> subsequently probable. Professor
Foerster feels this difficulty, and suggests a solution, which
a little more consideration would have shown him to be
untenable. On page xlvi. of his introduction to the
<i>Karrenritter</i>, he says, '<i>wenn wirklich Kristian zuerst den
Ehebruch eingeführt hat, so ist doch die Annahme zulässig dass
Verehrer Arturs und seiner Frau diese neue ehrenrührische
Erfindung zwar gekannt, aber mit Entrüstung abgewiesen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
haben, um ja nicht des idealen Königs Ehrenschild zu beschmutzen</i>.'
But a few pages further on the writer himself
refers to the story of Guinevere and Mordred as told by
Geoffrey<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and Wace. He must therefore be well aware
that there can be no possible question of Chrétien's having
<i>introduced</i> the <i>motif</i> of Guinevere's faithlessness; that
is one of the oldest and most original features of the
Arthurian story. The question is <i>not</i>, 'Did the queen have
a lover?'&mdash;that was answered in the affirmative long before
Chrétien's day&mdash;but, 'When did Lancelot become her
lover? Was it through the version of the <i>Charrette</i>?' a very
different matter.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Taking into consideration the construction of the poem,
and the character of the contents, I think we are justified
in considering the composition of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven as
a collection of <i>lais</i> which have not yet been worked over or
taken final literary shape. When the scattered Lancelot
stories did this, it was under the influence of a <i>motif</i>
foreign to the original legend, his love for Guinevere.
How that came to be introduced into the legend is a
matter for separate consideration, but I do not think there
is room for doubt that it was this introduction which
determined the final and literary form of the Lancelot
story. All conflicting elements, such as the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
love affairs, were rejected and only the original germ
retained.</p>

<p>And what was this germ? Authorities will no doubt
differ. Some perhaps will say it was the story of Guinevere's
imprisonment and rescue, but they must remember that
in the <i>Lanzelet</i> this is <i>not</i> the work of the hero. I think
myself that the root of the Lancelot tale was simply a
Breton <i>lai</i>, relating the theft of a king's son by a water
fairy: this seems to be the one abiding and persistent
element in the tale, all else is uncertain and shifting.
Here the hero is Arthur's nephew; elsewhere he is but
the son of an old ally; at one time his father is a tyrant,
'<i>chassé</i>' by his own people; again he is a noble king, the
victim of treachery and a foreign foe. Sometimes Lancelot's
mother lives to see him restored to his kingdom;
sometimes she dies while he is yet in the care of the fairy,
and never sees her son again. He has two cousins on the
father's side, Bohort and Lionel, and a bastard half-brother
Hector; he has no relations on his father's side,
but is cousin to Gawain through his mother. He is
Guinevere's lover; he is not Guinevere's lover. He is
unmarried; he is very much married&mdash;three times at
least! He has four children born in wedlock; he has but
one son, the offspring of a <i>liaison</i>. He is the most
valiant knight of Arthur's court; he is scarce worthy of
mention. Among all this shifting tangle and contradiction,
there is but one thing, and one only, fixed and certain, he
is Lancelot <i>du Lac</i>. I do not see how we can avoid the
conclusion that in this record of his youth we have the
one fixed point of departure for all the subsequent unfoldings
of romance.</p>

<p>Not that this story was always unvarying in its details,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
on the contrary we find in it marked divergences. Thus
in the <i>Lanzelet</i> the motive of the theft is clear, the fairy
desires a champion and protector for her cowardly son;
the motive in the prose <i>Lancelot</i> is not apparent; probably
it was a mere capricious fancy for a beautiful child.</p>

<p>And if the motive was not always clearly understood,
still less so was the character of the fairy. In fact she
seems to have considerably puzzled the mediæval romancers.
In the first instance the story would be excessively simple,
she would probably be such a water-fairy as we find in
<i>Tidorel</i>, and Ulrich seems to have retained this idea when
he calls her a <i>Merfeine</i> or <i>Merminne</i>, but as the <i>lai</i> gained
popularity, and it became necessary to supply details as to
her kingdom, etc., it would be supplemented from other
legendary sources. Ulrich's own description, the land of ten
thousand maidens where no man penetrates, is manifestly
the <i>Meide-land</i> which in <i>Diu Krône</i> Gawain visits, and
which is universally admitted to be a remembrance of
the 'Isle of Women' of old Celtic tradition. It may have
touched the Lancelot <i>lai</i> through the medium of the
Gawain's story, but as a 'property' of old Celtic belief it
may well have been known independently. I think it
probable that this identification may explain a very curious
passage in <i>Diu Krône</i>, where Kei reproaches Lancelot who
has failed in the glove test in the following terms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>er hât daz vil rehte erspeht,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>daz iz di gotinne</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>verkurt an ir minne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>diu iu zôch in dem sê</i>.'&mdash;ll. 24517-20.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Certain it is that while the queen of the 'Isle of Women'
does not appear to be addicted to child-stealing, she does
entice, or abduct, earthly knights to be her lovers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
is not impossible that a version of the <i>Lancelot</i> story,
redacted by some one familiar with the real character of
the kingdom, may have represented him as the queen's
lover. It is also not impossible, were this the case, that
the story of the imprisonment of Guinevere in the other
world, a story which, as we shall presently see, must have
existed at a very early date, may have led to her being
confused with the queen of that kingdom, and to the
transfer of Lancelot's affections from the one to the other.</p>

<p>The prose <i>Lancelot</i> version is entirely different, and far
less archaic: there is no real lake, the appearance is but
a <i>mirage</i>; men are admitted; Lancelot has not only his
cousins for companions, but other knights as well. The
lady herself is conceived of more as a mortal versed in
enchantment than as a fairy proper. In the <i>Suite de
Merlin</i> she is identified with the Demoiselle Chaceresse,
daughter of the King of Northumberland;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and in both
these romances, the <i>Lancelot</i> and the <i>Merlin Suite</i>, she
is the lover and the betrayer of Merlin. It may not be
out of place to remark here that the tendency of later
romances, as exhibited in the <i>Suite</i> and notably in Malory,
is to connect the Lady of the Lake rather with Arthur than
with Lancelot.</p>

<p>It may be asked, how did so simple a <i>lai</i> as we here
postulate attain so great a popularity? The incidents
would be few, and the characters at first probably anonymous.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Here, I think, we may take into account a factor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
hitherto practically ignored, the music of the <i>lais</i>. As
we know they were intended to be sung, and each was
connected with its own melody. It would be a truism
nowadays to say that the success of a song depends less
upon the words than upon the music to which the words
are set, and though less true of an age in which the songs
of the people were also its folk-tales, yet the influence of
music upon the development of popular legends is a point
we do ill to ignore. It may help us to solve certain
puzzles. Certain heroes of course represent what we may
call the general stock-in-trade of Aryan tradition: their
names vary with the lands in which their tales are told,
but whether Cuchullain or Gawain, Siegfried or Perceval,
the hero represents a traditional tale which antedates any
special form of recital; such a tale would be assured of
welcome, and practically independent of musical aid. But
in the case of Lancelot we have no such prehistoric
tradition, no striking parallels in early legends. Previously
unknown, he leaps into popularity, as it were, at a bound.
Even the most ardent adherent of Chrétien de Troyes
cannot appeal to the popularity of that writer to help us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>with a solution, for his Lancelot poem, the <i>Charrette</i>, is
but seldom referred to in contemporary literature. Much
of Lancelot's later popularity is doubtless due to his rôle
as the queen's lover; but how account for the initial
popularity which caused him to be chosen for that rôle?
I can only explain the phenomenon of a knight, whose
very name is unknown before the middle of the twelfth
century, becoming before the end of that century the
leading hero of a cycle to which he was originally a
stranger, by supposing that there was some special charm
in the <i>lai</i> originally connected with him, by means of
which his story took hold of the public fancy. Had that
charm been in the <i>lai</i> itself, in word or form, then I
think it would have been preserved to us. We possess
more than one beautiful <i>lai</i>, the hero of which, originally
independent of the Arthurian cycle, became by virtue of
his story admitted within the magic precincts. Failing
that, I think the charm must have lain in the air to
which it was wedded, and which so pleased the ears of the
hearers that they demanded its repetition, and lengthening,
by the addition of episodes foreign to the original tale.
Thus other <i>lais</i>, whose fate had been less happy, might
for a time at least win a spurious popularity, till the
'survival of the fittest,' which operates in literature as
elsewhere, discarded the weaker portions, and fixed the
outline of the story in the form we know. This theory
may or may not be correct, but I can suggest none other
that will meet the problems of the case; and at least it
has the advantage of offering an hypothesis which may
be of use in other stories besides the one under discussion.</p>

<p>But there is another point in the discussion of Ulrich's
poem which urgently demands attention. What is the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>nection
between the <i>Lanzelet</i> and the <i>Parzival</i> of Wolfram
von Eschenbach? A connection of some sort there is,
and that a fairly close one. Take for instance the passage
describing the hero's departure from his magic home for
the world of men, a passage extending over two hundred
lines (ll. 400-666). He does not know how to sit his horse,
how to hold the bridle,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or use his weapons; is ignorant
of his name and birth; is called <i>der kindische man</i> (l. 598),
<i>der namenlôse tumbe</i> (l. 2045), all features which irresistibly
recall Perceval to our mind, but are in no way characteristic
of Lancelot.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The tourney at which Lancelot makes his first appearance
at Arthur's court has been undertaken between King
Lot von Johenis and <i>Gurnemanz den fürsten wîs</i> (l. 2630).
It commences with a vesper play:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>engegen der vespereide</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>riten über jene heide,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>dort zwêne, dâ her drî</i>.'&mdash;ll. 2855-7.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the <i>Parzival</i>, Book <span class="smcap">II.</span>, we read of the tourney before
Kanvoleis that it began with a vesper play:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>von Póytóuwe Schyolarz</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>und Gurnemanz de Grâhárz,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>die tjostierten ûf dem plân.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sich huop diu vesperîe sân,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>hie riten sehse, dort wol drî.</i>'&mdash;ll. 295-9.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In connection with which we may note that both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Chrétien and Hartmann von Aue spell the name of
Gurnemanz with <i>o</i>, not with <i>u</i>, as does Wolfram. Other
names, some of them peculiar to Wolfram's version, occur
in the <i>Lanzelet</i>, such as Galagandreiss (Galogandres), also
found in Hartmann's <i>Erec</i> though not in Chrétien; Iwân
de Nonel, l. 2935 (<i>Parzival</i>, v. 312); Iblîs, l. 4060 (<i>Parzival</i>,
xiii. 895). Ulrich's Iblîs is connected with the cloister <i>jaemerlichen
urbor</i>, Wolfram's with <i>Terra de Lâbur</i>; Kailet, l. 6032
(<i>Parzival</i>, ii. 737); Maurîn, whose name in each case is
similarly qualified, <i>mit den lichten schenkeln her Maurîn</i>,
l. 3052, <i>Mit den sch&oelig;nen schenkeln Maurîn</i> (<i>Parzival</i>, xiii.
1069).<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In the description of Iweret we read, <i>einen wâfen
roc fuort er und guldîn schellen dran er schein ein engel
niht ein man</i>, ll. 4428-30, which should be compared with
the description of Karnachkarnanz.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>den dûhte er als ein got getân:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>er'n het ê 'so lichtes niht erkant.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>úfem tówe, der wâpenroc erwant.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>mit guldîn schellen kleine</i>.'&mdash;<i>Parzival</i>, iii. 175 <i>et seq.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now how are all these points of contact to be explained?
Scholars are agreed in placing the date of Ulrich's poem
in the opening years of the thirteenth century, therefore
anterior to the <i>Parzival</i>. Did Wolfram borrow from
Ulrich? If it were a mere question of a name here and
there we might think so, but the points of contact amount
to more than this. We have the characteristics of Perceval
postulated of Lancelot; we have correspondence in details,
even verbal identity; further, the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, as we shall
see, presents other points of contact with Wolfram's poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in details where he differs notably from Chrétien. It is
not probable that Wolfram, who never alludes to any
adventures related in the <i>Lanzelet</i>, and to all appearance
knows nothing of the hero save the <i>Charrette</i> adventure,
should have borrowed from two such widely different versions
of his story. The fact that where Lancelot appears to have
borrowed from the <i>Perceval</i> legend, the borrowed matter
is marked by characteristics special to one version of the
story is, to say the least, curious. If the <i>Lanzelet</i> <i>really</i>
preceded the <i>Parzival</i>&mdash;a philological question upon which
I am not qualified to pronounce an opinion&mdash;and Ulrich,
as is generally supposed, closely followed his source,
only one conclusion seems possible, <i>i.e.</i> that that source
knew, and quoted, the poem of Kiot. It is significant
that in the mention of Gurnemanz he is spoken of as
<i>den fürsten wîs</i>, which shows that to the writer he was
not a mere name, but a well-known character, distinguished
by the qualities which mark him in the <i>Parzival</i></p>

<p>My own impression is, however, that Ulrich knew
Wolfram's poem, or at least part of it (between the
<i>Lanzelet</i> and the last three books of the <i>Parzival</i> there
do not appear to be any points of contact). There are
numberless small coincidences in language and phrase,
trifling in themselves, but which as a whole seem to argue
a familiarity with the words of the <i>Parzival</i>. Such a
correspondence is more likely on the part of Ulrich than on
that of Wolfram, who by his own confession could not
read or write, and must have become orally familiar with
his source. But it is quite clear that a critical comparison
of the two works is urgently needed, both in the interests
of Arthurian tradition and of German literature. The
popular impression, <i>i.e.</i> that Wolfram merely borrowed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
few names from the <i>Lanzelet</i>, will not stand the test of
investigation. Two conclusions alone are open, from which
we must make our choice: either to admit the existence,
beyond any doubt, of the French poem, other than
Chrétien's, which Wolfram declared to be his source;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> or
to place the date of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven some few
years later than that usually assigned to him. We await
the aid of some one of the many competent scholars
Germany possesses to solve this puzzle for us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">LANCELOT ET LE CERF AU PIED BLANC</p>


<p>Before examining Chrétien's poem of the <i>Charrette</i>,
which, whatever the date of composition, belongs by the
nature of its contents to the later stages of Arthurian
tradition, it will be well to direct our attention to a
short episodic poem, undoubtedly French in origin, but,
so far as we at present know, only to be found in a
translation incorporated in the vast compilation known as
the Dutch <i>Lancelot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The contents of the poem are as
follows: A maiden arrives at Arthur's court, attended by a
brachet. She is the messenger of a queen who demands
a champion to accomplish the following feat: in her land
is a stag with one white foot, guarded by seven lions;
she promises her hand to whoever will slay the lions, and
present her with the white foot of the stag. The brachet
will be guide to any knight who may undertake the adventure.
Kay announces his intention of being the first
to try his fortune, and sets out, guided by the dog. After
riding some distance he comes to a deep and swiftly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
flowing river, which the dog promptly swims. Kay's
courage, however, fails him at the sight of the water, and
he turns back, feigning a sudden illness, which had prevented
him from pursuing the quest. Lancelot then
determines to try his fortune: he sets out, passes the river
in safety, and is attacked by the seven lions. After a
fierce conflict, in which he is desperately wounded, he
succeeds in slaying them, and secures the white foot. At
this moment a stranger knight appears, and Lancelot,
exhausted by the fight, gives him the foot, bidding him
carry it to the queen, and say that the knight who has
achieved the adventure lies sorely wounded, and prays
her aid. The knight promises this, but having received
the foot, deals Lancelot a treacherous blow with his sword,
and leaving him for dead rides off to the castle, and claims
the reward due to the slayer of the lions.</p>

<p>The queen is much distressed, as the knight is both
ugly and cowardly, and summons her lords and vassals to
ask their advice. They recommend that the marriage be
postponed for fifteen days, greatly to the disappointment of
the knight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gawain has become anxious at the non-return
of Lancelot, and sets forth to seek him. He finds
him apparently dead, revives him, and conveys him to the
dwelling of a physician, whom he instructs as to the proper
treatment,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and then rides himself to the court to punish
the treacherous knight.</p>

<p>He arrives on the eve of the marriage, accuses the knight
of his treachery, challenges him to single combat and slays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
him. The queen is much rejoiced at the news. Gawain
brings Lancelot to the queen, who regards him as her
future husband; but, on the excuse of calling together his
kinsmen for the marriage, Lancelot contrives to leave the
country, 'not for anything in the world would he have been
faithless to Guinevere.' He and Gawain return to Arthur's
court, and the queen is left vainly awaiting her bridegroom.</p>

<p>This conclusion is of course obviously lame and ineffective.
The hero should wed the maiden, whose hand
was the previously announced reward of successful accomplishment
of the feat. That Lancelot undertakes the
adventure at all can only be explained by supposing that
the tale was connected with him previous to his being
generally recognised as the queen's lover.</p>

<p>That he was not the original hero of the tale is proved
by the fact that we possess a Breton <i>lai</i> which relates the
story in a better and more coherent form, ascribing it to
a certain <i>Tyolet</i>, whom we do not meet in any of the later
Arthurian romances.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The main points in which the versions differ are: (<i>a</i>) the
maiden who comes to Arthur's court is herself the prize
of the victor. This is a better version, as it simplifies
the action, and accounts for the anxiety felt at the absence
of the knight, who should have returned to court at once
on achieving the venture. (<i>b</i>) Gawain's action (which is
the same in both poems, with the exception that instead
of his slaying the traitor, Tyolet arrives in time to prevent
a combat) is clearly explained; the brachet, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
acted as guide, returns alone to court, and leads Gawain
to the scene of the combat. In the <i>Lancelot</i> version
it is difficult to understand how Gawain, who had no
guide, finds his friend so quickly. (<i>c</i>) Tyolet weds the
maiden, and returns with her to her own land, where he
becomes king.</p>

<p>Here we have an unmistakable instance of a <i>lai</i> originally
told of another hero being transferred to Lancelot.</p>

<p>The story itself, however, seems to be older than its
connection with either hero; even in the <i>Tyolet</i> version,
superior as it is to the <i>Lancelot</i>, the real meaning of the
tale appears to have been overlooked or misunderstood.
In its original form I think it was clearly a transformation
tale. The stag was the enchanted relative of the princess
who sought the hero's aid, and the spell which detained
him in animal form could only be broken by the cutting
off of the foot. We know that the smiting off of a member
of the body (generally the head) is a well-recognised form
of terminating an enchantment, and in this case the
proposed solution would explain what, in the tale as it
stands, appears a piece of unredeemed brutality.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the <i>Tyolet</i> version is that it falls into
two well-marked divisions, the first recounting the upbringing
of the hero, and his arrival at Arthur's court,
a tale bearing a marked affinity to the Perceval <i>Enfances</i>;
the second being the 'white-foot' adventure. Now in
this first part the hero, going into the woods in search of
game, sees and follows a stag, which is transformed into
a man before his astonished eyes. I suspect that this
episode formed the connecting link between the two
sections of the <i>lai</i>, the real meaning of the latter stag not
having been lost when the two were united. A confirma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>tion
of this theory is found in the fact that one of the
numerous 'shape-shifting' changes of Merlin was into the
form of a stag with a white fore-foot.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I also think this
may well be the origin of the mysterious white stag
guarded by lions which meets us so often in later Arthurian
story. In the <i>Queste</i> stag and lions change into Our Lord
and the Four Evangelists, thus preserving the transformation
character.</p>

<p>But whatever the original character of the story, it has,
in the form in which we now possess it, become affected
by <i>a motif</i> extremely popular in mediæval times, that of
the <i>False Claimant</i>. The leading characteristics of this
widely spread tale may be summed up as follows. The
hero at great risk to himself performs a feat, and possesses
himself of a proof (previously agreed upon) that he has done
so. The traitor comes on the scene, possesses himself of
the proof (either attempting to slay the hero himself or
believing him to be already dead), and claims the reward;
not knowing that the hero has possessed himself of a further
proof of his deed. The hero, left for dead, recovers, and
appearing at the critical moment, confutes the traitor by
the production of the second and decisive proof.</p>

<p>Of this story practically countless variants exist; Mr.
E. S. Hartland, in his <i>Legend of Perseus</i>, vol. iii., has
tabulated a large number gathered from all parts of the
world. The most general version appears to be that in
which the feat consists in the slaying of a dragon, to be
testified by the production of the head. The hero, not
content with cutting off the head, also cuts out the tongue,
and is thus enabled to confute the traitor, who has omitted
to look within the monster's jaws. It will be noted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
neither in the <i>Tyolet</i> or <i>Lancelot</i> versions does the hero
possess such a proof: in the first instance the impostor is
put to shame by Tyolet's inquiry as to who slew the lions;
in the second Gawain settles the matter by slaying the
traitor. This lack of an important feature of the original
tale seems to indicate that the <i>lai</i> in its primitive form did
not belong to this group of stories, though from the character
of the feat related the borrowing of features from so
widely known a folk-tale was almost natural development.</p>

<p>A very good example of the <i>False Claimant</i> is found in
some versions of the <i>Tristan</i> legend, notably the poems of
Gottfried von Strassburg, and his source, Thomas of
Brittany: very few of the prose versions have retained it.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>M. Gaston Paris seems inclined to connect the 'white-foot'
adventure with this. Ultimately, of course, the
stories must go back to a common source; but the <i>Cerf au
pied blanc</i> presents the adventure in so general a form, that
one can hardly connect it with any special variant of this
very widespread folk-tale. The <i>Tristan</i> variant is, as I have
said above, an especially good example, with many well-marked
features, none of the more characteristic of which
are reproduced in the <i>lai</i>. But we have in the same
vast compilation the account of another adventure of the
same character, also ascribed to Lancelot, which does
appear to be directly drawn from the Tristan story.</p>

<p>In <i>Morien</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> we learn that Morien, Gawain, and Lancelot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
seeking for Perceval and Agloval, come to a hermit's cell
at four cross-roads. They ask whither the roads lead,
and learn that that on the right hand leads to a waste
land devastated by the ravages of a devil in the form
of a beast. Lancelot determines to brave the adventure
and, in spite of the remonstrances of the hermit, chooses
this road. The writer of the tale informs us (but it should
be kept in mind that the hermit <i>does not</i> tell Lancelot)
that the lady of the country has promised her hand to
whoever will slay the monster. A knight who has long
loved her, but is too cowardly to dare the venture, keeps
a watch upon all those who may attack the beast, with the
secret intention of, if possible, slaying the victor and taking
the credit of the deed to himself. Lancelot arrives at the
monster's lair, which is surrounded by the bones of men
and animals slain by the fiend. No description of the
creature is given, but it is quite clear from the incidental
details that the writer conceived of it as a dragon;
Lancelot's sword and spear can make no impression on
its skin; its claws pierce through shield and hauberk and
score deep wounds on the knight's body; it breathes
forth venom, which would have slain Lancelot but for the
ring he wore (no doubt the ring given him by the Lady
of the Lake); finally, as it opens its jaws to devour him, the
knight thrusts his spear down its throat and pierces the
heart. The monster utters a loud cry, which is heard over
two miles off, and expires. The traitor knight, hearing the
cry, knows that the monster is slain and rides to the spot.
Lancelot is binding up his wounds; the traitor approaches,
making feint to aid him, deals him a treacherous blow and
leaves him for dead; then he cuts off the foot and is
riding away when Gawain appears upon the scene and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
challenges him. Lancelot recovers from his swoon in
time to bid Gawain slay the traitor, which he does. Before
Lancelot can recover from his wounds news comes that the
King of Ireland has invaded Arthur's kingdom, and is
besieging the queen in one of her castles. Lancelot and
Gawain go at once to her aid, and nothing is heard of
the lady whose hand was to have been the reward of
the venture. But, as I have noted above, there is no sign
that Lancelot knew anything of the promised guerdon;
his conduct is therefore more intelligible and less unchivalrous
than in the <i>lai</i>.</p>

<p>The special points of contact with the <i>Tristan</i> story
are these: (<i>a</i>) The nature of the animal, which is undoubtedly
in both cases a dragon. (<i>b</i>) The hero undertakes
the adventure unsolicited. Tristan lands in Ireland,
hears of the dragon's ravages and goes off secretly to slay
it. He has no thought of winning Iseult for himself. In
both versions of the <i>lai</i> the lady herself invites the adventure.
(<i>c</i>) The character of the traitor: in both <i>Tristan</i>
and <i>Morien</i> he is represented as being too cowardly to
dare the feat himself but as watching his opportunity to rob
a brave man of the fruit of his valour. In the <i>lai</i> variants
'opportunity makes the traitor'; in these two versions the
traitor is on the watch for his opportunity. (<i>d</i>) In both
cases he is attracted to the spot by the death-cry of the
monster. The appearance of Gawain, on the other hand,
the death of the traitor, and the fact that it is the <i>foot</i> and
not, as it should be, the <i>head</i>, which is cut off, clearly
show the influence of the <i>lai</i>.</p>

<p>The ending is, of course, unsatisfactory, and it is curious
that the writer, who in the details noted above clearly
shows a knowledge of the excellent and complete version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the <i>Tristan</i> legend, should not have finished his story
more in accordance with that tale. It is not impossible
that the original adventure as contained in the <i>Morien</i>
poem <i>was</i> the stag adventure, and that the compiler of the
Dutch <i>Lancelot</i>, who evidently possessed an extensive
collection of Arthurian documents, knowing that he was
going to relate the story later on, purposely altered the
earlier portion more in accordance with the dragon adventure
of the Tristan tale, retaining the later portion for
the sake of the rôle played by Gawain, who is one of his
heroes, and who, it is scarcely necessary to say, does not
appear in the <i>Tristan</i> legend. Unfortunately we have
no other version of the <i>Morien</i> save that of the Dutch
<i>Lancelot</i>, so the question must remain undetermined; all
we can say with certainty is that the adventure as there
related is combined from two distinct variants of the same
original <i>motif</i>.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the <i>Morien</i> story is that it
shows the <i>Lancelot</i> legend influenced by the <i>Tristan</i> at
a point practically unconnected with the central <i>motif</i>
of that story, the loves of Tristan and Iseult.</p>

<p>The story of the <i>cerf au pied blanc</i> as attributed to
Lancelot does not appear to have obtained any popularity.
In no variant of the prose <i>Lancelot</i> is it related, or even
alluded to; the version preserved by the Dutch compiler
is, so far, the only one that has been discovered. But
existing as it does, it clearly points to a date at which the
Lancelot story was still told in isolated <i>lais</i>, and before
the introduction into the legend of his love for Guinevere.
Once fixed as Guinevere's lover, we can understand how
the tale dropped out of the completed legend: alter the
ending as they might the obstinate fact would remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
that Lancelot voluntarily undertook an adventure the
successful achievement of which would necessitate him
becoming the husband of a stranger maiden; it was an
<i>impasse</i> from which he could only escape at the cost of an
insult to one or the other queen, and very wisely the
compilers of his legend ignored the story.</p>

<p>It also seems probable that the original character of the
tale itself was not properly understood by its compilers:
an evidence, if evidence were really needed, of the extreme
antiquity and, if I may use the word, 'unlocalised'
character of the elements which went to compose the
Arthurian cycle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">LE CHEVALIER DE LA CHARRETTE</p>


<p>With the poem, the title of which heads this chapter,
we reach a fresh stage in the Lancelot tradition, and
one which, though it has already been the subject of
acute and scholarly discussion, still presents many points
of difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The story related in the poem is so well known, and
the poem itself so accessible, that it is unnecessary to do
more than summarise the leading features. It is, as we
all know, the story of Guinevere's abduction by Meleagant,
and her rescue by Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>A knight (Meleagant) appears at Arthur's court, and
boasts of the Breton subjects he holds in captivity. Arthur
can free them if he will commit Guinevere to the care of a
knight who will fight a single combat with him; if he
(Meleagant) be defeated, all the prisoners shall be freed;
if he be victor, Guinevere, too, is his captive. Kay, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
demanding from Arthur a boon, the nature of which
is unspecified, and which the king grants before hearing,
obtains permission to escort the queen. Gawain follows,
meets Kay's horse, riderless and covered with blood, and
is then confronted by an unnamed knight (Lancelot), who
begs the loan of a steed. Gawain gives him his, and follows
on a spare steed as quickly as possible, only to find traces
of a sanguinary conflict, and his own horse slain. He
overtakes Lancelot, who, meeting a dwarf driving a cart,
mounts after a momentary hesitation, and the two continue
the pursuit together. Meleagant's land (or rather that of his
father Baudemagus) is surrounded by deep water, crossed by
two bridges, one of a sword-blade, the other under the water.
Lancelot chooses the first, crosses in safety, fights with
Meleagant, and frees Guinevere, who, however, receives him
coldly, being offended at his momentary hesitation before
mounting the cart. Lancelot, in despair, tries to commit
suicide; Guinevere, hearing a rumour of his death, is overwhelmed
with grief, and on his next appearance receives
him with the greatest favour. They pass the night together,
Lancelot gaining access to the queen's chamber by means
of a heavily barred window, and severely wounding his
hands in wrenching asunder the bars. The traces of
blood on the bed-clothes cause the queen to be accused
of a <i>liaison</i> with Kay, who, severely wounded, is sleeping
in the ante-chamber. Lancelot undertakes to prove
Guinevere's innocence by a combat with Meleagant, which
shall take place at Arthur's court; but, having set out
to seek Gawain, is treacherously decoyed into prison by
his foe. Meleagant, by means of forged letters, persuades
the queen that Lancelot has returned to court, whither
Guinevere repairs, escorted by Gawain, who has mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>while
arrived on the scene. Lancelot, who has been
released on parole by his jailor's wife, to attend a tourney,
is subsequently walled up in a tower by Meleagant, from
which prison he is released by his rival's sister, and
reaching court at the last moment, overcomes and slays
Meleagant.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The capital importance of this poem lies in the fact that
here, for the first time, so far as our present knowledge
goes, we meet with those relations between Lancelot and
the queen which form so important a part of the completed
Arthurian legend. Are these relations, then, an invention of
Chrétien, or were they already familiar to the public for
whom he wrote? Here I shall only treat this question
incidentally, deferring a full study of the point to a subsequent
chapter; the questions which mainly concern us
relate rather to the nature (<i>a</i>) of the story itself, (<i>b</i>) of
Chrétien's share in its development.</p>

<p>In the introductory lines we learn that the poem was
written at the instance of the Countess Marie de Champagne,
who supplied '<i>Matiere et san</i>.' I take this to mean that
she only supplied a verbal outline of the story, and left it
to Chrétien to fill in details. Thus, as regards source,
Chrétien stands in a different position in this poem than
in his other romances. In every other instance he had
either in <i>livre</i> or <i>conte</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> (which latter I take to be the
recital of a professional story-teller) a fixed source from
which he drew his tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The internal evidence agrees with these indications: the
<i>Charrette</i> is far inferior to Chrétien's other work; the
construction is feeble in the extreme, and bristles with
contradictions and obscurities. Why, for instance, does
Meleagant suggest that Guinevere shall be put in charge of
a knight and follow him? Why not challenge a single
combat at the court, where there would be a public to see
that the rules of such combat were observed? It may be
that the original scene of abduction was a wood, and this
is an awkward attempt to combine a later version, <i>i.e.</i>
Arthur's court, with a primitive feature; but in any case
it starts the story on wrong lines. Gawain (who is also
mounted) follows <i>directly</i> on Lancelot's track, but before
he comes up with him there has been time for a fierce
conflict to take place. These conflicts with a valiant
knight do not as a rule terminate so quickly, even though
the odds be unequal! Gawain, who of course knows
Lancelot well, apparently fails to recognise him, even when
he unhelms for supper. The maiden of the castle warns
them against sleeping in a certain bed; whoever does so
will scarce escape with his life. Lancelot braves the
adventure, but the next morning when he is found safe
and well, the lady expresses no surprise. We are told
that the maiden whom Lancelot frees from the knight at
the ford knows him and <i>is afraid he will know her</i>, but no
explanation of this is vouchsafed, and her identity is not
revealed. We are expressly told that the kingdom of
Gorres is surrounded by a water which none may pass,
but before Lancelot even arrives at the water and bridge
he is in the kingdom of Gorres, peopled by captive
Bretons. No explanation is given of how Guinevere knew
of Lancelot's hesitation to mount the cart; there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
witness but the dwarf, and if he noted so momentary an
indecision he must have had a curiously keen appreciation
of the rules of <i>Minne</i>; and how did he come to see
Guinevere? But perhaps it was a case of telepathy. In
the same manner Kay becomes mysteriously aware of
what has passed between Lancelot and the queen. And
these instances might be indefinitely multiplied. Chrétien's
<i>Lancelot</i> is scarcely less incoherent than Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's;
and we begin to wonder if there were not some
inherent weakness in the legend itself, which rendered it
impossible for any one to give an intelligible account of
the hero's proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>I think it is clear that the decided inferiority of the
<i>Charrette</i> as compared with Chrétien's other poems is due
to the deficiencies of his source. He was left in the lurch,
and his genius was not of a nature to extricate him from
his difficulties. When he had before him a story the form
of which was already practically fixed, and which required
polishing rather than rearrangement, Chrétien could put
it into charming language, and make a finished and
artistic piece of work out of a simple original. I should
express the charm of his work as being that he clad the
folk-tale in the garments of the court, and taught it to
move easily in its foreign trappings. But when his materials
were scanty, and he was called upon to supplement them
from his own imagination, he was unequal to the task; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
he was artist enough to know it, and to leave unfinished a
work which did him little credit, while he turned to one
the nature of which precisely suited his special talent. It
is not, I think, without significance that the best of
Chrétien's poems follows immediately on his worst. He
had a reputation to retrieve, and he did it gallantly in
the <i>Yvain</i>.</p>

<p>Nor is Chrétien really successful in depicting lovers as
lovers: they are little more than lay figures; they talk at
great length, and indulge in analysis of their feelings,
expressed in the most graceful and ingenious language;
but one</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Iseut ma drue, Iseut m'amie,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En vous ma mort, en vous ma vie!</i>'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is worth all Chrétien ever wrote on the subject; the breath
of the god is not in it. Yet, so far as the <i>Charrette</i> goes,
this is scarcely to be laid to his blame. Nowhere, save
perhaps in one chapter of Malory, is there the least ring
of reality in the loves of Lancelot and Guinevere. They
go through all the prescribed gestures of their rôle with
admirable precision. Guinevere is by turns gracious, disdainful,
frantically jealous, and repentant of her jealousy;
Lancelot is courteous, humble, despairing, hopeful: their
relation to each other is all that <i>Minne dienst</i> can require
between a knight and his lady, but nowhere in the whole
wearily drawn-out story does the real, pent-up human
feeling break through. We can never imagine these two
taking one another by the hand and wandering off into the
wilderness, content, and more than content, with each
other's presence. The story of Lancelot and Guinevere
is artificial, not natural; it demands the setting of the
court, not of the woodlands. Only in the passage where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Malory describes their parting do they, for a moment,
become real; and the effect produced is probably due to
the simplicity of the old knight's language, and the virile
force of the English tongue.</p>

<p>Nor do I think that these relations are due to Chrétien.
He treats them as an already established fact, well known to
his readers, and needing no explanation. Certain episodes
of the poem, the finding of the comb, the testing of the
knight's fidelity to the queen by the lady in whose castle
he passes the night, presuppose a state of things generally
familiar. Every one knows who Lancelot is; every one will
know why he, and no other knight, shall rescue the queen.</p>

<p>That there was a previous story of Guinevere's rescue
from imprisonment under analogous circumstances is quite
clear: the references found in the Arthurian romance are
too numerous, and too archaic in form to be derived from
a poem so late in date, so artificial in character, and so
restricted in popularity as the <i>Charrette</i>. Of this story we
have at least three distinct accounts: (<i>a</i>) that given by
Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, where the 'other-world' character
of the imprisonment is strongly marked, but the rescue is
the work of an enchanter, and not of Arthur or any of his
knights; (<i>b</i>) that given in the <i>Vita Gildæ</i>, when the
abductor is Melwas, king of <i>Æstiva Regis</i> (Somerset),
the place of imprisonment Glastonbury, and there is
again no special rescuer, Arthur marches at the head of
his armies to her relief, but it is the intervention of
St. Gildas and the Abbot of Glastonbury which brings
about the desired result; (<i>c</i>) the account given in the
poem under discussion.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>Of these three variants the version of the Lanzelet stands
by itself; it represents the 'other-world' under an entirely
different, and probably more primitive, aspect, and makes
no effort at localisation.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The other two variants fall
together, Melwas, the king of <i>Æstiva Regis</i>, which is
admittedly Somerset=Meleagant of Gorres, whose chief
city is <i>Bade</i>=Bath, also in Somerset. These later versions
have been localised, and I think it is clear that the
localisation took place on English soil, <i>i.e.</i> it is an insular
and not a continental variant.</p>

<p>Now, from the very nature of the story it is clear that
in its <i>earliest</i> forms it would not be attributed to any special
locality, and therein the <i>Lanzelet</i> version again appears to
be the elder; further, the variants must have arisen at a
time when it was clearly understood that, however they
might apparently differ, Valerîn's thorn-girt dwelling and
Meleagant's water-circled castle meant one and the same
thing, <i>i.e.</i> that both were recognised methods of describing
the 'other-world.' In this connection it is instructive to
recall the versions of Brynhild's wooing by Siegfried; her
residence is universally admitted to be an 'other-world'
dwelling, and we find it depicted under forms closely
corresponding with the variants of the Guinevere story;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
<i>e.g.</i> Waberlohe (<i>Volsunga saga</i>)=Valerîn's hedged magic
slumber; Castle surrounded by water (<i>Thidrek saga</i>)=Meleagant's
stronghold; Glasberg (<i>Folk-songs</i>)=Glastonbury.
The parallelism is significant.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It is quite clear, I think, that such a story can be in
no way ascribed to the invention of a poet living towards
the end of the twelfth century, but must be of very much
earlier date. Chrétien was dealing with a late variant of
a primitive and very widely known theme. But could this
variant, which, as seems probable, only reached him through
the medium of a tale related by the Countess Marie of
Champagne, have come from England, to which country
the localisation of Glastonbury, Somersetshire, and Bath
point? It is quite possible. We must remember who
Marie de Champagne was: she was a princess of France,
the daughter of King Louis VII. and Eleanor of Aquitaine,
who, on her divorce from the French king, married Henry
of Normandy, afterwards Henry II. of England. That is,
at the time Chrétien wrote, the mother of his protectress
was Queen of England and wedded to a sovereign who
took a keen and personal interest in all that concerned
King Arthur. The <i>possibility</i> of transmission is as clear
as daylight; the question of course is, Would Marie be
inclined to take advantage of it? The relations between
her father and his divorced wife were certainly curious,
as Louis made no objection to the marriage of the eldest
son of Henry and Eleanor with his daughter by his second
marriage, but whether there was intercourse between mother
and daughter I have not been able to discover. But the
question ought to be easily solved by some historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
specialist who has made a study of that period. The
point is interesting and important, and it is to be hoped
some one will clear it up for us.</p>

<p>A question of secondary interest is whether Chrétien's
poem is the source of contemporary and later allusions
to the story. Of such allusions, or rather versions, we
have two of special importance, that contained in Malory's
compilation, and that given by Hartmann von Aue, in his
<i>Iwein</i>. With regard to the former, I can only say that
though I am in a position to offer new and important
evidence with regard to the manuscript Malory used, and his
method of composition, yet that evidence leaves the
<i>Charrette</i> question unsolved. Of <i>direct</i> evidence there
is none; the <i>indirect</i> and <i>inferential</i> evidence tends to
show that Malory's source was <i>not</i> the poem of Chrétien
de Troyes. The two points on which we can be certain
are, (<i>a</i>) that Malory did not know the earlier part of the
prose <i>Lancelot</i> at all, that his manuscript began at a point
subsequent to the <i>Charrette</i> adventure; and (<i>b</i>) that he does
not invent adventures, and but rarely details. Dr. Sommer's
conclusions, as set forth in his <i>Study on the Sources of
Malory</i>, are founded on very insufficient premises, and
will need to be thoroughly revised to bring them into
accordance with our present knowledge. This question
I shall discuss fully in a later section. The <i>Iwein</i> version
is of great importance, and though I have previously
referred to it,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> yet in the light of Professor Foerster's
strongly repeated assertion that Hartmann knew no other
version of the story than that given by Chrétien, I think
it is worth while going over the evidence again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>It must be remembered that Hartmann's <i>Iwein</i> is a
translation of Chrétien's <i>Chevalier au Lion</i>, and though
rather more diffuse, follows its source closely. In the
French poem which, as we have noted above, immediately
succeeded the <i>Charrette</i>, Chrétien deftly introduces more
than one allusion to Guinevere's abduction. He says
that Guinevere has been carried off by a knight <i>d'estrange
terre</i>, who went to the court to demand her; but he would
not have succeeded in carrying her off had it not been
for Kay, who deceived or deluded (<i>anbricona</i>) the king into
putting the queen in his charge (ll. 3916-39). In another
place, he says that the king, '<i>Fist que fors del san Quant
aprés lui l'an anvoia. Je cuit que keus la convoia Jusqu'au
chevalier qui l'an mainne</i>' (ll. 3706-11). Now, let us
suppose that, as Professor Foerster insists, Hartmann had
not read the <i>Charrette</i> and knew no other version of the
story, what would he, who knew French well, and translates
without blunders and confusion, understand by this?
We must note particularly what Chrétien tells and what
he omits. He distinctly says that the knight came to the
court and demanded the queen (the real version of the
poem is less blunt, as we have seen); that Arthur, deluded,
put the queen in Kay's charge to lead her to the knight,
and that they followed him. He does <i>not</i> say that the
whole catastrophe came about through Arthur's granting
a boon before he knew in what it consisted; he implies
that the folly lay in Arthur's sending the queen after the
knight, not in the circumstances which forced him to
do so.</p>

<p>Now what does Hartmann say? In his version a
knight appeared before Arthur and demanded a boon,
the nature of which he refused to specify beforehand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Arthur granted it. It was that he should carry off the
queen. This he did. The knights armed and followed.
Kay was the first to overtake him, and was struck from
his horse with such violence that his helmet caught in a
tree and he hung suspended. He was not carried off
captive. One after another all the knights are vanquished,
and the queen carried off. Gawain is not at court; he
returns the next day, and goes in search of the queen.
Lancelot is not mentioned throughout; and the inference
is that Gawain frees her.</p>

<p>What is specially noticeable in this account is that
Hartmann agrees with Chrétien in the very feature which
the French poet does <i>not</i> specify, <i>i.e.</i> the cause of the
queen's abduction&mdash;a boon rashly granted, though he
transfers the asking from Kay to the knight; while he
differs from Chrétien in the feature which he <i>does</i> specify,
<i>i.e.</i> that Kay takes Guinevere <i>after</i> the knight. Further,
he adds details which would clear up some of the inconsistencies
in Chrétien's own account: <i>i.e.</i> if Gawain were
not present at the time, and all the knights followed one
after the other and were defeated by Meleagant, we can
quite understand that when Gawain returned the next day
and followed on the trail, he <i>would</i> find traces of the severe
and bloody conflict for which Chrétien's version leaves
no room. On the face of it, Hartmann's version is much
the more logical and coherent of the two. I have remarked
above on the extreme awkwardness of the action at the
outset of the story; that Meleagant should carry off Guinevere
by a ruse similar to that employed by Gandîn in the
<i>Tristan</i> poems is far more in accordance with mediæval
tradition. If Hartmann's divergence is a mere 'invention,'
he not only deserves praise for his sagacious skill in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>structing
a story,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> but excites admiration for the acuteness
which enabled him to detect the leading <i>motif</i> of the
adventure to which his source afforded absolutely no clue.</p>

<p>Wolfram von Eschenbach's references to the <i>Charrette</i>
adventure are curious; at first sight it seems certain that
he is referring to Chrétien's poem, but on closer examination
the matter is not so clear. Thus he says that Lancelot
crossed the sword-bridge, fought with Meljakanz (Meleagant),
and freed Guinevere&mdash;all of which agree with
Chrétien.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But, on the other hand, he mentions Kay's
suspension on the tree (Hartmann's version), and does
not know that Meleagant was slain by Lancelot, or that
the captive Bretons were freed by his coming&mdash;both Meleagant
and the Breton knights are fighting at the tournament
of Beaurösch.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Indeed, Wolfram appears to know far
more of these latter than can be gathered from Chrétien's
poem. Of course, we cannot here say whether these
references are due to Wolfram or to his source, which, as
recent research has clearly shown, was certainly the work
of a man of varied and extensive learning.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Nor is it at
all clear that Wolfram knew Lancelot as Guinevere's lover;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
he simply says that her imprisonment grieved him '<i>im was
gevancnisse leit, die frou Ginòvêr dolte</i>,' which might be
postulated of any loyal servant of Arthur's. Again when,
at the beginning of Book xii., the poet recites Gawain's
love-sorrows, he compares his pains first to those suffered
by various heroes in the achievement of knightly deeds
in general, and then rehearses the parallel cases of sundry
lovers. In the first list Lancelot and the sword-bridge
appear in company with Iwein and the fountain, and Erec
and the '<i>Schoie de la kurt</i>' adventure, neither of which
were undertaken for the sake of love (why Garel slew the
lion and fetched the knife, we do not know), but among
the lovers he and Guinevere are not mentioned.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the fact that the story is, by
its very nature, far older than any literary form we possess;
that there was certainly in existence one version at least
other than Chrétien's (proved by the <i>Lanzelet</i>); and that
Chrétien's source was avowedly an <i>informal</i> one, I do not
think it impossible that in the poems of Hartmann and
Wolfram we have references to the original form of the story
of which Chrétien had only an incomplete knowledge. Hartmann's
version is certainly not drawn from the <i>Charrette</i>;
in Wolfram's case we can only give the verdict '<i>not proven</i>.'</p>

<p>In the whole investigation I think we can only consider
two points as satisfactorily settled: the original
character of the story, and the fact that Lancelot was not
at first the hero of the adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">THE POSITION OF CHRÉTIEN DE TROYES IN THE
ARTHURIAN CYCLE</p>


<p>At the stage which we have now reached in our examination
of the <i>Lancelot</i> legend, it is, I think, imperative to
form a clear idea of the position which, in the great body
of Arthurian literature, shall be assigned to the author of
the romance we have last studied. On the question of the
literary excellence of Chrétien's handling of his material
all are more or less agreed, but the problem of his relation
to his sources, the question whence he drew the stories he
told with such inimitable grace and felicity, is one which
has long provoked a lively interchange of argument.
The romances of Chrétien de Troyes form one of the
chosen battlegrounds of widely differing schools of
Arthurian criticism.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as during the varying fortunes of a long-continued
conflict the elementary principles underlying
the views respectively advocated have a tendency to
become obscured, and gradually misunderstood, it is well
that from time to time they should be clearly and formally
re-stated, in the light of such knowledge as recent investigation
may have cast upon them. We are then in a better
position to judge whether they retain, unimpaired, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
force and cogency their adherents have ascribed to them.
Professor Foerster has apparently felt this necessity, and,
impelled by it, has, in the introduction to his edition of
the <i>Charrette</i>, given to the world what he evidently
intends us to regard as his matured and final conclusion
on the question of the source of Arthurian dramatic
tradition.</p>

<p>Doubtless a similar statement from some leading scholar
among the many who hold views differing from Professor
Foerster will be forthcoming; in the meantime the present
study appears to me to offer an excellent opportunity for
the re-statement of certain principles, and the reiteration of
certain facts, which cannot safely be left out of consideration
in such a study, and which Professor Foerster's
argument practically ignores.</p>

<p>To understand the position of Chrétien de Troyes to his
sources, whatever they may have been, we must, in the
first place, have possessed ourselves of the answer to two
leading questions. (<i>a</i>) What is the nature of the Arthurian
tradition itself? (<i>b</i>) What was the popular form assumed
by that tradition at the time Chrétien wrote? These are
the main points, but they, of course, involve subsidiary
issues.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the tendency of the school represented
by Professor Foerster is to regard the Arthurian
tradition as divided into two branches, historic and
romantic. The former branch being <i>primarily</i> represented
by the <i>Historia</i> of Geoffrey of Monmouth, the popularity
of which practically introduced Arthur to the literary
world, and <i>secondarily</i> by certain passages in the earlier
prose romances. This branch contains features of <i>insular</i>
origin, reminiscences of the historic Arthur and his fights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
with the Saxons; but the second and far more important
branch, the romantic, is of purely <i>continental</i> origin.
Arthur, as a romantic hero, is the product of Breton
tradition and folk-lore; Armorica, and not Wales, is the
cradle of Arthurian (romantic) legend; and it was
Geoffrey's <i>Historia</i> which gave the requisite impulse to the
formation of this tradition.</p>

<p>So much for theory, what now are the facts?</p>

<p>Without in any way minimising the popularity and
influence of Geoffrey's work, either in its original form or
in the translation of Wace, it is quite clear (<i>a</i>) that it did
not represent <i>all</i> the historic tradition current concerning
Arthur; (<i>b</i>) that his popularity was of considerably earlier
date. A comparison with the <i>Brut</i> of Layamon<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> will
prove the first point; for the second, we have already
noted Professor Rajna's discovery of Arthurian names in
Italian documents as proving that such names must have
been popular in Italy at the end of the eleventh century.
Further, from the testimony of the bas-relief at Modena
we see that the traditions associated with the British king
were not purely historic, but that he and his knights
were already the heroes of tales which have not descended
to us. We cannot, therefore, fix with any approach to
certainty the date at which Arthur became a romantic
hero, but evidence points to a period anterior to that
generally admitted.</p>

<p>Then ought we not to distinguish between <i>romantic</i> and
<i>mythic</i>? Professor Foerster's arguments appear to me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
ignore Arthur as a <i>mythic</i> hero. Romance and myth are
not the same thing; though their final developments are
apt to overlap, their root origins are distinctly different.</p>

<p>The mythic element in Arthurian legend cannot be
ignored&mdash;in fact, it is practically admitted; but some
scholars appear to lose sight of its character. Yet if that
character be rightly apprehended it will, I think, be
recognised that the distinguishing features are not due to
any demonstrable Armorican element; that the connection
of Arthur with Celtic myth must have taken place on
<i>insular</i> rather than on <i>continental</i> ground. Thus while
Arthur may, or may not, represent the <i>Mercurius Artusius</i>
of the Gauls, it is not possible to deny that he, and at least
one of his knights, Gawain, stand in very close relation
to early Irish mythic tradition. The persistence of Irish
elements in the Arthurian story is not a theory but an
established <i>fact</i>. Where would these stories, Arthurian
and Irish, be most likely to meet and mingle, in Great
Britain, or in Armorica? The first is <i>a priori</i> the more
probable; not only is the distance less, but we know that
during the centuries between the life of the historic Arthur
and the appearance of Arthurian story a constant interchange
of population went on between Ireland and the
northern parts of the British Isles. The conclusion at
which we should naturally arrive would be that stories in
which the Celtic element was presented under a form
identical with early Irish tradition would reach Brittany
<i>viâ</i> Great Britain, and would not be of Armorican origin.</p>

<p>And this conclusion is strongly supported by the
facts. We have two remarkable stories told of Gawain,
both of which find striking parallels in early Irish legend,
both are excellently preserved in insular versions, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
is adequately represented by any known continental text.
I allude of course to <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>
and <i>The Marriage of Sir Gawain</i>.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Of the first the existing French versions are, one and all,
poor; immensely inferior to the English poem, and
showing in certain cases, notably in <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>,
a manifest lack of comprehension of the story. The
German version, <i>Diu Krône</i>, is preferable to any of the
French, but in no case is the story so well and fully told
as in the English poem, which cannot possibly be derived
from any known continental source. Of the main point
of the second story, the wedding of a young knight to a
'Loathly Lady,' the French poems have no trace, though
some seem to have retained a confused remembrance of
the transformation of a hideous hag into a maiden of
surpassing beauty. Mr. Maynadier, in his study of all the
known variants, pronounces unhesitatingly for the direct
dependence of the English upon the Irish tradition.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In the first story, the Green Knight, the original hero of
the beheading challenge, is Cuchulinn, who, if he does not
himself represent a god, is certainly the son of a god. In
the second the lady is 'the sovereignty,' and through granting
her request the hero obtains the sovereignty of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Both are thus distinctly mythical in character; and
though the English versions, as we now possess them, are
of comparatively late date, in neither case can the Irish
version be later than the eleventh century, while the
internal evidence points a period anterior to the introduction
of Christianity.</p>

<p>Let us take another instance, the story of Guinevere's
abduction and rescue. Of purely mythical origin, the story
was at first unlocalised, but when localised it is on insular
and not on continental ground. To say, as Professor
Foerster does,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> that the mention of Bath is no proof of
an insular source simply shows that the writer has not
grasped the real facts of the case. The mention of Bath
does not cover the whole ground, it must be taken in
connection with <i>Æstiva Regis</i> (Somerset) and Glastonbury.
The latter is, if I mistake not, the real point of identification.
A confusion between Glastonbury, Avalon, and the
abode of the departed had taken place previous to William
of Malmesbury: the exact date cannot be ascertained, but
M. Ferd. Lot considers the author of the identification to
have been an Irish monk writing in the tenth century.
In a subsequent note M. Lot further identified Melwas=Meleagant,
whom all scholars admit to be a king of the
other-world, with the Irish 'king of the dead,' <i>Tigern-Mas</i>,
of which name he considers Mael-was to be the
Welsh translation.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Now it seems to me quite obvious that the connection
of the king of the other-world with the place looked upon
as the special dwelling of the departed must have <i>preceded</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
his being considered as lord also of the surrounding lands,
<i>i.e.</i> Tigern-Mas=Maelwas must have been connected with
Glastonbury=Avalon <i>before</i> he was thought of in connection
with Bath and <i>Æstiva Regis</i>. It is most probable
that such a connection would take place on <i>insular</i> not
on <i>continental</i> ground, and as a matter of fact the only
text which connects Melwas with Glastonbury, the <i>Vita
Gildæ</i>, is an insular text, as is that which connects
Glastonbury with Avalon. Here, too, again, if M. Lot
be right, we find Irish influence at work.</p>

<p>It is probable that we may be able to add to this list
the story of Arthur's fight with the demon cat. The
story is certainly told in a continental text (<i>Merlin</i>), and
located on continental ground, but the identification of
the monster with the <i>Cath Palug</i> of Welsh tradition and
that again with the mysterious <i>Chapalu</i> of French romance
depends on insular evidence.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>In his notice of Herr Freymond's monograph<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> M. Gaston
Paris suggests that the source will be found to be 'un
trait sans doute fort ancien, de mythologie celtique, que
Gaufrei de Monmouth n'a pas accueilli'; while M. Loth,
in a note appended to this critique, remarks that the
original vanquisher of the cat was certainly not Arthur
but Kay. The localisation of the story in Savoy, Herr
Freymond considers to have been due to the narration of
pilgrims, and discusses the relations of the houses of
Savoy and Flanders with our Anglo-Norman kings.</p>

<p>Here then we have a group of stories, possessing a
distinctive (Celto-mythic) character, all of which are either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
better preserved, solely retained, or originally localised
in these islands; <i>i.e.</i> the evidence of facts is here in
favour of an insular rather than a continental origin. Nor
do I think we shall be wrong if we ascribe a decided
importance to the fact that the tales told in these islands
appear to have been of a mythic rather than of a romantic
character.</p>

<p>Granting then, that at Chrétien's time, and long previous,
there was current a body of tradition, historic, mythic,
romantic, dealing with the British king, how was it handed
down, and in what shape did he find it? Of course it
will generally be admitted that for a long time the transmission
of such stories would be entirely&mdash;in Chrétien's
days it would still be partially&mdash;oral.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But in saying
this we must have a clear idea of what, in the case of
traditional stories, oral transmission implies. It does <i>not</i>
mean a game of 'Russian scandal,' where the point is to
see how much a story told from mouth to mouth can be
made to vary from its original form in the process;
professional story-<i>tellers</i> were, and are, more conservative
than story-<i>writers</i>. The tales crystallise into certain
formulæ of incident and expression which survive often
after the real signification has been forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In the words of a recognised authority on folk-lore:
'Among many peoples the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of traditional
tales are insisted upon; the form, and even the details of
the form, are often as much a part of the tradition as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
substance of the tale.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Therefore when we find two
stories of marked traditional and folk-lore character
agreeing with each other in sequence of incident, detail,
and even words, we do not necessarily conclude that the
versions are connected by borrowing: they may be, but it
is at least equally possible that they represent independent
versions of the same oral original.</p>

<p>This is, of course, well understood by the folk-lore
student; but unfortunately it is too often ignored by the
literary critic, who is too prone to devote attention to the
literary form, while he ignores the essential character of
the story. Yet in solving the problem of sources it is
this latter which is the determining factor.</p>

<p>In examining into the sources of Chrétien de Troyes it is
well to remember that it is easy to exaggerate the necessity
for a literary source; it is difficult to exaggerate the conservative
tendencies of a professional story-teller of that date.</p>

<p>But besides the Arthurian legend proper, there was also
current in Chrétien's time a great mass of popular folk-lore,
which, certainly on the Continent, probably also on
our island,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was told, or rather sung, in the form of
mythical tales or <i>lais</i>. These <i>lais</i>, in the first instance in
the Breton tongue, and independent of the Arthurian
cycle, were later translated into French eight-syllabic verse,
and largely Arthurised&mdash;if I may use the word.</p>

<p>The process in vogue appears to have consisted of two
stages: in the first, the king at whose court the events
took place (himself generally anonymous) was identified
with Arthur; in the second stage, the original hero was
replaced by one of Arthur's knights. Among the speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>mens
which have been preserved we have examples of all
the stages: <i>lais</i> entirely independent of Arthur; <i>lais</i>, the
scene of which is laid at Arthur's court; <i>lais</i> in which the
hero is one of Arthur's knights; but one and all are in the
same metre, that of Chrétien's poems. Of an intermediate
French form we have no trace.</p>

<p>The <i>lai</i> of <i>Tyolet</i>, to which we have previously referred,
is an excellent example of this gradual 'Arthurisation.'
As we have it, the court at which the events take place is
that of Arthur, the loyal friend of the hero is Gawain, but
nowhere else do we meet with Tyolet as one of Arthur's
knights: the inference is that we have here a <i>lai</i> in the
first stage of assimilation. The <i>lai</i> consists of two parts;
the latter half, the stag adventure, is found in a separate
form, but here the hero is one of Arthur's most famous
knights, Lancelot&mdash;the process of assimilation is complete.</p>

<p>The first part of the <i>lai</i> has many features which recall
the more famous 'Perceval' <i>Enfances</i>. That <i>Tyolet</i> is
anterior to the evolution of the Lancelot story we have
shown above<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; the probability is that it is also anterior to
the great popularity of the <i>Perceval</i> story. When Perceval
was once universally recognised as the son of the widowed
lady of the forest, there would be little probability of the
tale being told of a hero practically unknown to Arthurian
story. His adventures taken over by more famous knights,
Tyolet disappeared from the roll of heroes.</p>

<p>Again, among the <i>lais</i> we have an important group
dealing with the main idea of a knight beloved by
the wife of his lord, rejecting her advances, incurring
her displeasure, and finally departing to fairyland with
a fairy bride. Of this story we have three important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
variants, agreeing in their main features but differing in
detail: the <i>lais</i> of <i>Graalent</i>, <i>Guingamor</i>, and <i>Lanval</i>. Of
these three, the scene of the two first is laid at the court
of an anonymous king; the action of the third, translated
by a contemporary of Chrétien, passes at the court of
Arthur. But, though the <i>lai</i> of <i>Guingamor</i> has only
reached us in its earlier and independent form, Chrétien
himself refers to it in an Arthurised version. He brings
Guingamor to Arthur's court, and says of him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>de l'Isle d'Avalon fu sire.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De cestui avons oï dire</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qu'il fu amis Morgain la fee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et ce fu veritez provee.</i>'&mdash;<i>Erec</i>, ll. 1955-8.</span>
</div></div>

<p>M. Ferd. Lot<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> suggests that the identification is probably
due to Chrétien himself, but if we examine the passage
closely I do not think we shall find it to be so. It occurs
in a list of knights who visit Arthur's court for the marriage
of Erec. The passage immediately preceding deals with
a certain Maheloas of l'Ile de Voirre.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He then names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
two brothers, Graislemier de Fine Posterne and Guingamor.
The first named is generally identified as Graalent-Mor, the
hero of the <i>lai</i> to which I have referred above.</p>

<p>The fact that Chrétien makes the two knights brothers
clearly indicates that he knew the close kinship existing
between their stories; but why, if dealing with a free hand,
he should have made Guingamor, and not Graalent, the
lord of Avalon it is difficult to say. If free to choose we
should have expected the latter; the <i>lai</i> of <i>Graalent</i>
stands in far closer connection with that of <i>Lanval</i> (being
a variant of the same story) than with that of Guingamor;
and Lanval weds the mistress of Avalon. Or, since both
were brothers, both might have been represented as
dwelling in that mystic island which had not one queen
alone as its denizen but nine. The real explanation alike
of the connection and the separation of the two knights
appears to me to be that Chrétien knew the one <i>lai</i>,
and not the other, in an Arthurised form.</p>

<p>Certainly it seems more probable that the gradual assimilation
by the <i>lais</i> of an Arthurian character would, so far
as the Continent is concerned, take place on Breton rather
than on French grounds. They are originally Breton <i>lais</i>;
Arthur is a Breton,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> not a French, hero; where would
Breton folk-lore and Breton traditionary romance be more
likely to coalesce than in the home of both? I do not
myself believe that such coalition was the work either of
Marie de France or Chrétien de Troyes.</p>

<p>In any case it is beyond the shadow of a doubt that
when Chrétien wrote his first Arthurian poem there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
already afloat a vast body of popular folk-lore connected
with the Arthurian legend, and existing under the form of
short poems in rhymed, eight-syllabic verse, the same
metre, in fact, as that adopted by Chrétien himself. It is
also certain that he knew these <i>lais</i>; highly probable that
he knew some of them, as his contemporary Marie de
France did, in their Arthurised form. As we shall see
presently, there is strong ground for the presumption that
for the main incident of his most famous poem, <i>Yvain</i>, he
was indebted to such a <i>lai</i>.</p>

<p>Now, without accepting the mechanical theory of Herr
Brugger,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which would make the first Arthurian romances
consist of <i>continental lais</i> automatically strung together, I
certainly think that the <i>lais</i> played a more important part
in the evolution of these romances than we generally
realise. In a previous chapter<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> I have indicated what
would probably be the method of procedure. The original
<i>lai</i> would be expanded by the introduction of isolated
adventures; other <i>lais</i>, which through demerit of style
or music had failed to win popularity, would be drawn
upon for incident, or incorporated bodily; one or more
popular <i>lais</i> would be added, and the whole worked over
and polished up into a complete and finished romance.
At first the parts would hang but loosely together, and
there would be a good deal of re-selection and discarding
of incident before the work crystallised into shape, though
the form of the <i>original</i> tale, which was the kernel of the
subsequent romance, would not be likely to vary much.</p>

<p>The <i>Lanzelet</i> of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven is, as I suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
above, an example of a romance arrested in development:
the kernel of the whole can be detected, but the parts fit
badly, and it has never been really worked up into shape.
But, unless I am much mistaken, we have in the Welsh tale
of <i>The Lady of the Fountain</i> a specimen of the same
process at work, of capital importance for critical purposes,
since we also possess the completed work, <i>i.e.</i> the Mabinogi
has preserved Chrétien's <i>Yvain in process of making</i>. The
adventures are practically identical, sequence and incident
agree in the main, but in the Welsh version they are much
more loosely connected, and there are significant breaks
which seem to show where the successive redactions ended.
If we follow the indications of the version we shall conclude
that <i>as first told</i> the story ended with Yvain's achievement
of the 'spring' adventure and his marriage with the lady.
This would, I think, represent the original <i>lai</i>, which in
its primitive form might well be unconnected with Arthur's
court: the king was probably anonymous. The next step
would be to Arthurise the story; Yvain must start from
Arthur's court, and naturally the court must learn of his
success: this was arranged by bringing Arthur and his
knights to the spring where they are themselves witnesses,
and victims, of Yvain's prowess. It is significant that in
<i>all</i> the versions extant Yvain is influenced in his secret
departure from court by the conviction that <i>Gawain</i> will
demand the adventure of the spring, and thus forestall
him; but in the Welsh variant alone is this forecast literally
fulfilled and the undecided conflict between Yvain and
Gawain fought at the spring. And here the Welsh version
breaks again. This was evidently the end of the Arthurised
<i>lai</i>, and the point where the conflict between the friends
was <i>originally</i> placed. All the variants bear the trace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
this second redaction; the Welsh tale alone indicates
clearly what was the primitive form. Yvain's transgression
of his lady's command (probably first introduced for this
purpose), a transgression much more serious in the Welsh,
where he stays away for three years, than in the other
versions, offered an elastic framework for the introduction
of isolated adventures; finally, when the whole was worked
over in romance form, his combat with King Arthur's
invincible nephew was transferred to the end of the poem,
where it formed an appropriate and fitting climax to his
feats.</p>

<p>The theory suggested above is based upon certain
recognised peculiarities in the evolution of the Breton
<i>lais</i>; but the question whether we are justified in making
such use of ascertained facts naturally depends upon
whether the story related in the romance in question
was in its origin one that we might expect to find related
in a <i>lai</i>; if it were <i>not</i>, then, however rational the
hypothesis may otherwise appear, we should regard it with
suspicion as lacking solid foundation.</p>

<p>Granting then that a considerable share in the completion
of Arthurian romantic tradition was due to the influence
of <i>lais</i> originally independent of that tradition, that the
process of fusion had already commenced when Chrétien
wrote his poems, and that he was himself familiar with
such <i>lais</i>, each of the above points having been already
proved, our next step must be to examine the <i>character</i> of
the stories related by Chrétien.</p>

<p>Two of the five works we possess (I do not count the
<i>Guillaume</i>, which whether it be by Chrétien or not lies
outside the scope of our inquiry) must at once be put
on one side. Neither <i>Cligés</i> nor the <i>Charrette</i> story (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the form Chrétien tells it) can be based upon <i>lais</i>. But
the character of the three more famous poems, <i>Erec</i>,
<i>Yvain</i>, and <i>Perceval</i>, is precisely that of a romance
composed of traditional and folk-lore themes. In the
case of <i>Erec</i> and <i>Perceval</i> this is partially admitted even
by the most thoroughgoing advocate of Chrétien's originality,
though Professor Foerster would limit the element
to the <i>Sparrow-hawk</i> and <i>Joie de la Court</i> adventures in
the first, and to Perceval's <i>Enfances</i> as representing a
<i>Dümmling</i> folk-tale in the second.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>On this subject I shall have more to say later on; for
the present I will confine my remarks to <i>Yvain</i>, on the
construction of which Professor Foerster holds a theory,
highly complicated in itself, and excluding, as a necessary
consequence, any genuine folk-lore element.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>According to this view the main idea of the poem is
borrowed from the story of <i>The Widow of Ephesus</i>, a tale
of world-wide popularity, the oldest version of which
appears to be Oriental (Grisebach considered it to be
Chinese), and which in Latin form, as told first by Phædrus
and then at greater length in the compilation of <i>The Seven
Sages of Rome</i>, was well known in mediæval times.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> With
this is combined other elements: a Breton local tradition,
classical stories (the Ring of Gyges and the Lion of
Androcles), and other stories of unspecified origin.</p>

<p>On the face of it, this theory postulates a highly artificial
source, and one calling for great powers of invention and
combination; and when we examine it, we find the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
idea wholly inadequate to sustain the elaborate fabric
reared upon it. I have carefully studied <i>The Widow
of Ephesus</i>, both in earlier and later variants, and can
only see the slightest possible resemblance to the <i>Yvain</i>
story; true, in both a widow, overcome with grief for the
loss of her husband, speedily forms a fresh attachment,
but situation, details, <i>motif</i>, all are radically different. In
every variant of the first story the lady's action is prompted
by mere sensual caprice; in the second, it is the outcome
of a sound instinct of self-preservation. True, Laudine
does eventually fall in love with <i>Yvain</i>, but she contemplates
marriage with him before she has ever beheld him,
influenced by the advice of her servant, who paints in
strong colours the defenceless condition of the land, and
who is aware of Yvain's passion for her lady. In <i>no</i> variant
of the earlier tale does the lady marry the slayer of her
husband (a point, I believe, essential to the <i>Yvain</i> story).
Indeed, in many her advances are rejected by the object
of her passion; in <i>all</i> she is represented as refusing to
leave the grave, and none are free from the repulsive
details accompanying her new-fledged passion, though
these are amplified in the later versions. In insisting on
the fact that the lady's re-marriage (often entirely lacking
in the earlier story), '<i>unter hässlichen unser Gefühl
schwer verletzenden Bedingungen</i>,' is the central point of
both stories,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Professor Foerster overshoots his mark.
The conduct of the Lady of Ephesus is certainly offensive
in the highest degree, not so that of Laudine. For a
woman, especially if she were an heiress, in mediæval times
marriage was an absolute necessity. The true parallel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Laudine is here <i>not</i> the widow of many wanderings, but
the Duchess of Burgundy, in <i>Girard de Viane</i>, who, on
the death of her husband, promptly appeals to Charlemagne.
'<i>A quoi sert le deuil?&mdash;donnez-moi un autre mari. Donnez
moi donc un mari qui soit bien puissant.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> <i>Un mari bien
puissant</i> was a necessity of those days. The real truth is,
that the situation was already in the story, and mediæval
compilers explained it in accordance with the social conditions
of the time, and the parallel situations in contemporary
stories.</p>

<p>A minor objection to the theory is, that it would make,
not the hero, but the lady, the real centre of the story,
which is certainly not the case. But, as we shall see, the
tale in its original form is far older than Chrétien, <i>and
could by no possibility have been invented at so late a date
as Professor Foerster suggests</i>.</p>

<p><i>Yvain</i>, as one of Arthur's knights, is of a date considerably
anterior to Chrétien. We find him in Wace's <i>Brut</i>, as
a valiant hero, on whom Arthur, after the death of Aguisel,
bestows the crown of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Now, Professor Foerster
himself states, and I think the great majority of scholars
will fully agree with him, that neither <i>Erec</i>, <i>Yvain</i>, nor
<i>Perceval</i> were <i>originally</i> Arthurian heroes, and undoubtedly
their connection with Arthur's court was of the slightest.
If their connection with Arthur marks a secondary
stage in the story, and <i>Yvain</i> in the <i>Brut</i> is already an
Arthurian knight, it is pretty obvious that the original tale
connected with him, by virtue of which he was admitted
into the magic circle of Arthurian romance, must be older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
even than Wace; in other words, he must have been the
hero of a popular adventure upwards of thirty years, at
least, before Chrétien wrote his poem. And if that original
story was not the fountain-story, what was it?</p>

<p>But if we look at the tale aright, I think we shall discover
that its essential character is so archaic that it may well
be as old as the most exacting criticism can require. What
is it but the variant of a <i>motif</i> coeval with the earliest
stages of human thought and religious practice&mdash;the tale
of him '<i>who slew the slayer, and shall himself be slain</i>'?
The champion who must needs defend his charge single-handed
against all comers, and whose victor must perforce
take his place; and how old this tale may be, Mr. Frazer
has taught us.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>This surmise is strengthened by the nature of the
challenge; Yvain's pouring the water, which is followed
by a storm, is a simple piece of sympathetic magic&mdash;of rain-making,
and, as such, is practised even to-day by savages
in different parts of the world. Such a story must, by its
very nature, have been originally <i>un</i>localised, even as it
cannot be dated; it could be postulated of <i>any</i> place, it
might be practised everywhere&mdash;it belongs just as much,
and just as little, to South Africa in the present day as to
the wood of Broceliande in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>To treat such a story as a local tradition is a grave error.
It may have recalled in its details certain stories told of
the Fountain of Barenton, and, therefore, when transported
to the Continent from Wales (to which country the earlier
redaction certainly belongs), the continental story-tellers,
finding the Fountain unlocalised, as it naturally was in
the original tale, connected it with the Breton forest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
But it is obvious that such connection is purely arbitrary,
and has no critical value. It is at variance with all the
geography of the story, which is located in Wales or on
the Welsh border; and neither the compiler of the Welsh
version nor the English translator of Chrétien's poem admit
it, but adhere to the earlier and unlocalised form.</p>

<p>I may here quote a remark of the distinguished folk-lore
authority to whom I have previously referred. Mr.
E. S. Hartland says: 'The rain-making incident has always
seemed to me a very good evidence of the traditional origin
of the (<i>Yvain</i>) story. At all events it is an incident very
closely connected with savage magic.'</p>

<p>I do not suppose it would very much astonish any competent
student of these questions if some missionary in
Africa, or traveller in the South Sea Islands, was to publish
a savage variant of our romance: the substitution of the
slayer for the slain, and the practice of rain-making by the
pouring out of water, are customs alive in certain parts of
the world to this day. But what would Professor Foerster
say? Would he still maintain that his '<i>Meister</i>' invented
the story, and credit the savage folk, whoever they might
be, with the remains of a vanished civilisation and literary
culture?</p>

<p>I think it also highly probable that in the <i>Balaan and
Balaain</i> story, and in <i>Meraugis de Portlesguez</i>, we have
variants of the same theme. In each of these cases the
hero must take the place of the champion he defeats, and
hold the post till in his turn he be defeated and slain;
while at the same time he succeeds to his predecessor's
relations with the lady of the castle, whose <i>ami</i> he becomes.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
It will be observed that Herr Ahlström's suggestion that
the lady may originally have been a fairy&mdash;a suggestion
contemptuously scouted by Professor Foerster<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>&mdash;might be
accepted without any detriment to the original signification
of the story, whereas Professor Foerster's theory excludes
any possible archaic origin, and is demonstrably out of
harmony with the very primitive rain-making incident.</p>

<p>It is obvious that such a tale as I have indicated above,
belonging as it does to the family of folk-lore and traditional
tales, is precisely the kind of story that might be
related in a <i>lai</i>; and this was, I believe, its original form.
It is significant that Chrétien records the fact that there
was a <i>lai</i> more or less closely connected with the lady who
became Yvain's wife; and, according to the reading of one
<span class="smcap">MS.</span>, that connection was very close indeed, being nothing
less than the relation of how Yvain won her to wife.</p>

<p>I print here the reading to which I refer, together with
that of Professor Foerster's edition:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>It will be observed that, grammatically, the phrase 'don an
note un lai' may refer to the wedding quite as well as to the
supposed Laudunet, while <i>in no other passage in the entire
poem</i> is the lady's name or that of her father mentioned.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">MS.</span> which offers the interesting variant quoted
above is, Professor Foerster tells us, in the dialect of
Champagne (Chrétien was a Champenois) of the thirteenth
century, and stands in close relation to the source of
Hartmann von Aue's translation.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>For many reasons it appears to me that this reading
deserves more attention than it has yet received. It is,
to say the least, curious that Chrétien should go out of
his way to remark upon a <i>lai</i> dealing with an absolutely
unknown personage and one to whom he never refers again.
Chrétien's poems stand, <i>not</i> at the commencement of the
Arthurian tradition, but at a very advanced stage of
its evolution: had there been current at that date, the end
of the twelfth century, a <i>lai</i> important enough to be
chronicled in this unusual manner (I can recall no other
instance in Chrétien's poems), some trace of the hero of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the <i>lai</i>, if not the poem itself, would surely have been preserved
to us. On the other hand, the version given in the
Welsh tale has a break precisely at this point, showing
where the primary redaction ended, and the character of
the tale is, as we have seen, such as might well be preserved
in a <i>lai</i>. I believe that Chrétien is here indicating
the original source of this section of his poem.</p>

<p>The passage, moreover, has a curious affinity with one to
which I shall have occasion to refer later on, where the
carelessness of a copyist in running together two or three
words has created what the editor of the text read as a
proper name, a reading adopted by his critics. But here
the text had not been worked over, and the result was a
confused reading which has baffled more than one commentator.
The mere chance that the right reading (here
undoubted) has been preserved in a text hitherto unaccountably
neglected has enabled me to detect the error;
but had the copyists of the <i>Queste</i> been as careful to preserve
the grammatical sense as those of the <i>Yvain</i>, we should
have been much puzzled to decide whether <i>D'Estrois de
Gariles</i> was or was not originally <i>des trois de Gaule</i>!<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>It is a question for experts in palæography which is the
more likely error to be made, the running of two or three
words into one, eventually read as a proper name, or the
separation of the letters composing a proper name into two
or three words.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the arguments advanced for the
above view are, as compared with Professor Foerster's
arguments, <i>objective</i> versus <i>subjective</i>. Professor Foerster
sees in the story of Yvain and his lady a resemblance to
the tale of the <i>Widow of Ephesus</i>, <i>therefore</i> he concludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
that Chrétien based his romance on that story; but in
support of his theory he offers no <i>proof</i> whatever: there is
no evidence that Chrétien knew the tale, no reference to a
book in which it might be contained, no correspondence
of name or phrase, and the most characteristic incidents,
the dwelling by the grave, and the insult to the corpse,
have no parallel in the romance.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The evidence is purely
subjective; satisfactory to the framer of the theory, but not
satisfactory to others.</p>

<p>The evidence for the theory advanced above is, on the
contrary, purely objective. The story must be of such a
character that it might be told as a <i>lai</i>&mdash;it is of such a
character, <i>i.e.</i> folk-lore and traditional; <i>proof</i>&mdash;the rain-making
incident, and correspondence with the <i>motif</i> of
'slayer and slain.' We must have proof that Chrétien
knew the <i>lais</i> current in his day&mdash;he refers to one of the
most famous, <i>Guingamor</i>, and couples the hero with that of
another, <i>Graalent</i>. We should like a reference to a <i>lai</i>
connected with the story&mdash;we have the reference, at the
very point where, according to our theory, we might
expect to find it. Further, the reading of one <span class="smcap">MS.</span>, and
that neither a late nor a poor one, gives a remarkable
indication of the contents of the <i>lai</i>. If on these grounds
we decline to accept the <i>Widow of Ephesus</i> theory we are
surely neither prejudiced nor oblivious of facts.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is Professor Foerster more fortunate in his theory of
the origin of <i>Perceval</i>. He states it at great length in the
introduction to the <i>Charrette</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> but the main points may be
summarised thus. The book given to Chrétien by Count
Philip of Flanders was a <i>Grail</i> as distinct from a <i>Perceval</i>
romance. The two were independent stories and their
combination was the work of Chrétien de Troyes. 'Dieser
original Gralroman enthielt natürlich keinen Perceval
und auch nicht dessen Sagen-motiv, sondern wird den uns
sonst bekannten Gral-texten ähnlich gewesen sein.'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> 'Sollte
das <i>livre</i> aber, aller Unwahrscheinlichkeit zu trotz,
dennoch ein Perceval (d. h. Dümmlings-) Roman gewesen
sein, so erklärt sich ebenfalls warum das <i>livre</i> nicht gefunden
worden ist: <i>der Name Perceval stand natürlich
nicht in demselben sondern ist durch Kristian von einem
schon in Erec genannten Ritter auf den Helden übertragen
worden</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Into such pitfalls can the obstinate adherence to a preconceived
idea lead the most distinguished scholar! What
are the facts? In <i>Erec</i>, Chrétien mentions Perceval by
his full title, Perceval li Galois, as at Arthur's court, but
does not include him in the list of knights of the Round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Table;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but in <i>Cligés</i>, written some years later than <i>Erec</i>,
and according to Professor Foerster himself <i>between twenty
and thirty years before the Perceval</i>, the whole position is
changed: Perceval is not merely one of Arthur's knights,
but second in rank, inferior only to Gawain, thus displacing
<i>Erec</i>, whose praises Chrétien had sung at length,
and superior to Lancelot, whom the poet also celebrated
before he wrote of Perceval.</p>

<p>This is the position. Cligés has come to a tournament
at Ossenefort, and has on the first two days overthrown
successively Segramore and Lancelot; on the third day:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">Del ranc devers Ossenefort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part uns vassaus de grant renon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Percevaus li Galois ot non.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lués que Cligés le vit movoir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et de son non oï le voir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que Perceval l'oï nomer,<br /></span></i>
<span class="i0"><i>Mout desirre a lui asanbler</i>.'&mdash;<i>Cligés</i>, 4826-32.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the Perceval who was only a name to
Chrétien! But Chrétien's hero knows him! Can we
avoid the conclusion that, at the time <i>Cligés</i> was written,
Perceval was already the hero of a well-known and highly
popular tale; so popular that the author felt justified in
displacing in his favour the hero (Erec) whose deeds he
had already sung with such marked success? If the
story of Perceval li Galois be due to Chrétien, then we
must believe that, having conceived the tale in his mind,
and paved the way for its reception by the above reference,
he yet abstained from presenting it to the public for nearly
thirty years! Or could Perceval have been the hero of
some other tale, the popularity of which has waned before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
that of Chrétien's poem? Of any story connected with
him save the <i>Enfances-Grail</i> adventure there is no trace,
and of these we have variants of the former <i>minus</i> the
Grail tradition (<i>Peredur</i> and the English <i>Sir Percyvelle</i>); but
all the Grail stories know the <i>Enfances</i>.</p>

<p>It is also significant that Chrétien in the <i>Erec</i> mentions
both Gurnemanz (Gornemant) and L'Orguelleus de la
Lande, both of them noted characters of the <i>Perceval</i>
story; in fact, but for that story the former would be
nothing more than a name to us.</p>

<p>I have remarked in a note to chap. ii. that Chrétien
apparently also knew the enchanter of the <i>Lanzelet</i>. I
had not noted this till I had completed my study of the
poem, and, as a footnote is apt to be overlooked, I draw
attention to it here. In the list of the knights of the
Round Table given in <i>Erec</i>, Chrétien ranks as eighth
Mauduiz li Sages; in Hartmann's translation the name
is given as Malduiz li Sages; <i>Diu Krône</i> has Malduz der
Weise; the <i>Lanzelet</i> spells the enchanter's name Malduz
or Malduc, and qualifies him as der Wîse.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>I do not think there can be the least doubt that it is
one and the same individual who is referred to in these
quotations, and the only adventure known of him, and
one which would fully account for his sobriquet <i>li Sages</i>,
is one which is preserved in a poem bristling with <i>Perceval</i>
allusions,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the <i>Lanzelet</i> of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>I have said above that a critical edition of the <i>Lanzelet</i>
is urgently needed, and I should not be surprised if the
result of a close examination of that poem were to show
good reasons for fixing the date of the <i>Perceval</i> story (as a
<i>Perceval</i> and not a mere <i>Dümmling</i> story) at a much earlier
period than we have hitherto been inclined to admit.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Is it not the fact that story-tellers in mediæval times
depended for their popularity less upon the <i>manner</i> in
which they told their stories than on the stories themselves?
<i>i.e.</i>, if they wished to write a really popular poem
they took a subject already popular, and which they knew
would be secure of a favourable hearing. Are we really
so unreasonable when we contend that it was the traditional,
folk-lore, popular character of the stories told in
<i>Erec</i>, <i>Yvain</i>, and <i>Perceval</i>, which made them so much
more popular than <i>Cligés</i>? The <i>Charrette</i> is so manifestly
inferior to Chrétien's other works that we will not call it
as evidence; it was, and deserved to be, little known.
But <i>Cligés</i> stands on a different footing. The story is interesting,
it is well written, and the love-tale of Alexander
and Soredamors contains some of the poet's most characteristic
writing; yet, compared with the other poems, it
took little hold on the popular fancy. Was it not because
the story was unknown to the general public with whom
the tale itself counted for more than the skill with which
it was told?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>I cannot but think that to treat such stories as the three
named above, solely as <i>Arthurian</i> stories, is to base our
criticism of them on an entirely false foundation: they
are only Arthurian in a secondary sense, and criticism of
them, to be accurate and scientific, must be founded as
much on folk-lore as on literary data. Nor, I submit, are
arguments, which may be sound enough as applied to the
rise of the Arthurian romantic legend, of necessity equally
sound when applied to stories of independent origin incorporated
in that legend. I do not say for a moment
that Arthur as a <i>romantic</i> hero is a continental creation,
personally I very much doubt it; but of this I am quite
certain, were that continental origin proved up to the hilt,
it would still leave unsolved the problem of the origin of
these stories.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter I would touch for a moment
on the geographical questions involved; for it seems to
me that not sufficient account has been taken of the
marked difference between the geography of these three
and that of Chrétien's remaining two poems. The first
three have a common character. Yvain's adventures pass
in and on the borders of Wales. He starts from Carduel
en Galles (Kardyf in the English version), and after one
night's rest reaches the fountain. It is at Chester, not
otherwise an Arthurian town, but one well within the
bounds of the story, that his wife's messenger finds him.
Erec is '<i>d'Estregalles</i>'; the towns are Caradigan, Carduel,
Cærnant, Nantes. So with Perceval, who is <i>li Galois</i>, we
have Carduel, Dinasdron, the Forest of Broceliande&mdash;exactly
the geography we might expect in stories of Welsh
origin redacted on Armorican ground. Many of the names
here, as in certain of the <i>lais</i>, may be either insular or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
continental, inasmuch as they are common to the Celtic
race on both sides of the Channel.</p>

<p>But in <i>Cligés</i>, and in a minor degree in the <i>Charrette</i>,
we are on different ground: the geography is that neither
of Wales nor of Brittany. Here we have Dover, Wallingford,
Winchester, Windsor, Southampton, Oxford, Shoreham,
Bath, London; while we note a marked omission of the
distinctively <i>Arthurian</i> localities. The <i>Charrette</i> opens at
<i>Carlion</i>, which it, however, apparently confuses with <i>Camelot</i>.</p>

<p>Now this is surely significant. If Chrétien had a free
hand in the arrangement of his stories, if they were really
compounded of elements drawn from all sources and thus
combined for the first time, why did he shift his <i>mise-en-scène</i>
backwards and forwards in this curious manner?
Why turn from the geography of <i>Erec</i> to that of <i>Cligés</i>
and the <i>Charrette</i>, only to revert to his first love in <i>Yvain</i>
and <i>Perceval</i>? Is it not most probable that in those three
stories, at least, he was dealing with traditional matter, the
localising of which had already been effected?</p>

<p>In the case of <i>Cligés</i> and the <i>Charrette</i> it seems not
improbable that closer investigation may find grounds to
support the theory of a possible Anglo-Norman transmission,
which would account for the southern England
geography.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>A point on which we may well lay stress is, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
independence of Chrétien as a story-teller does not stand
or fall with the existence or non-existence of Anglo-Norman
Arthurian poems. Their importance, in relation to
Chrétien, may easily be exaggerated by those unfamiliar
with the character of oral tales. If we once accept as
a principle the well-ascertained fact that such stories have
a tendency to fall into a set form, a fixed sequence of
incident and detail, would always be related in practically
the same words, and, moreover, could well contain more
than one <i>sagen motif</i>, we shall realise that the necessity
of postulating a written source as explanation for the agreement
in sequence, incident, and phrase, becomes infinitely
less pressing.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>To my mind, the correspondences between the Welsh
Arthurian tales and Chrétien's three poems in question offer
no proof that the former repose directly on these poems as
basis; but I consider it extremely probable that many
of the perplexing features of the question&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the occurrence
in the Welsh stories, and in translations of Chrétien's
poems, of details not to be found in the best <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
poems&mdash;may be accounted for by copyists and translators
familiar with an oral version of the tale, filling in details
which Chrétien had either never heard, or had purposely
omitted. If we postulate, as from the character of the
stories we are justified in doing, a very widespread knowledge
of those tales, apart from any written source, we
shall not be surprised at the existence of a large number
of minor variants; the impossibility of explaining which
on purely literary grounds drives Professor Foerster and
those who share his views to the unsatisfactory expedient
of multiplying <span class="smcap">MS.</span> 'families.'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>To sum up the considerations advanced in the preceding
pages, I think we are justified in saying that the real <i>crux</i>
of Arthurian romance is the period <i>before</i> and not <i>after</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Chrétien de Troyes. Not that the latter period does not
offer us puzzles: it does, many and great, but when we
arrive at some definite and <i>proven</i> conclusion as to the
materials with which the earliest compilers of metrical
romance were dealing, we shall have made a great step
towards unravelling the problem of their successors. So
far, I do not think we have arrived at such a conclusion;
many theories are in the field, but none seem entirely to
meet the conditions of the question. My own conviction
is that, whether oral or written, Arthurian romantic
tradition is of much older date than we have hitherto been
inclined to believe.</p>

<p>To arrive at any solid result in our investigations there
are certain principles which we must always keep in view,
<i>e.g.</i>, if the Arthurian tradition consists (as it admittedly
does) largely of folk-lore and mythic elements, it must,
so far as these elements are concerned, be examined and
criticised on methods recognised and adopted by experts in
those branches of knowledge&mdash;and not treated on literary
lines and literary evidence alone. Thus it is essential to
determine the original <i>character</i> of a story before proceeding
to criticise its literary <i>form</i>. To treat stories of folk-lore
origin from an exclusively literary point of view is to render
a false conclusion not merely probable but <i>certain</i>.</p>

<p>In every case where an oral source appears probable, or
even possible, we must ascertain, from the evidence of
experts in story-transmission, what are the characteristics
of tales so told, and what is the nature of the correspondence
existing between tales of common origin but of
independent development.</p>

<p>The evidence of proper names is valuable only in a
secondary degree, as testifying to the place or places of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
redaction. But the older the story the less valuable they
are as indications of original <i>source</i>, the oldest tales having
a strong tendency to anonymity. So we find that in the
<i>lais</i> the older versions only speak of 'a king,' the later
identify that king with Arthur.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>If we take these elementary tests, and apply them to
those of the poems of Chrétien de Troyes for which
a traditional origin may safely be postulated, we shall I
think arrive at the conclusion that there is little ground
for ascribing <i>inventive</i> genius to the poet, whose superiority
over his contemporaries was <i>quantitative</i> rather than <i>qualitative</i>.
He differed from them in degree, not in kind; he
had a keener sense of artistic composition, a more excellent
literary style. Given the same material as his
contemporaries he produced a superior result; when the
material was deficient, as in the <i>Charrette</i>, the result was
proportionately inferior.</p>

<p>There is no necessity to belittle him as '<i>ein sklavischer
Übersetzer</i>'; there is no ground that I can see for crediting
him with an inventive genius foreign to his age. The truth
lies, as it so often does, midway between the two extremes.</p>

<p>In this connection I may well quote Dr. Schofield's
sober and carefully reasoned conclusion to his <i>Study of the
Lays of Graalent and Lanval</i>: 'The process of combining
separate episodes to make an extended poem, we may
well believe, had begun before the time of Marie's contemporary,
Chrétien de Troyes. He simply carried it one
step farther, and devoted his great literary talent to
presenting in more attractive form, with more modern
courtly flourishes, the stories already existing. Doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
he himself made new combinations, and in so doing was
guided by a poet's sense of appropriateness, choosing such
general and subordinate episodes as would contribute best
to the development of his hero's character.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> To him we
must certainly ascribe the interesting psychological discussions
so numerous in his works. But still his power of
invention is not great. His art is shown above all in the
way in which he combines and arranges separate stories,
or embellishes those already told at considerable length.'<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>These words, I believe, state in generous terms the
position which scientific criticism will ultimately assign to
Chrétien de Troyes: they represent the very utmost that
can reasonably be claimed for him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>Herr Brugger's article, referred to on p. 66, did not come into my
hands until these studies were in proof. Inasmuch as the theory
regarding the Arthurisation of the <i>lais</i> stated in this chapter and in
chapter ii. might lead some readers to the conclusion that my views
are identical with those set forth in the article in question, I think
it well to state (<i>a</i>) that I only postulate of certain early metrical
romances an origin which Herr Brugger apparently attributes to <i>all</i>
Arthurian romances, prose or verse; (<i>b</i>) that when Herr Brugger
speaks of <i>origin</i> he uses the word loosely, and in a <i>secondary</i> sense,
whereas I use it in a <i>primary</i>; <i>e.g.</i> to say that a story which reached
French writers through a Breton source may therefore be accurately
described as of Breton origin is, in my opinion, both inaccurate and
misleading, especially in the face of Professor Foerster's strongly reiterated
denials of an insular Arthurian <i>romantic</i> tradition. The
immediate source of the French writers does not solve for us the problem
of the origins of Arthurian tradition; it is a mistake to employ an
argument, or use terminology, confounding two distinct questions.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">THE PROSE LANCELOT&mdash;THE 'ENFANCES' OF THE HERO</p>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have examined certain
romances of the <i>Lancelot</i> cycle lying outside the great
prose compilation which represents its final form. The
<i>popular</i> 'Lancelot' legend was the legend as told in the
prose <i>Lancelot</i>, and the <i>Grail</i> romances therewith incorporated.
It is with these romances we must now deal.</p>

<p>The elements composing this vast compilation (which in
its completed form appears to have aimed at embracing
the entire Arthurian cycle in all its ramifications) are so
diverse that it would, under any circumstances, be a matter
of great difficulty to decide how best to analyse and examine
the composite structure; and this initial difficulty is
much increased by the fact that so far the material at our
disposal, abundant though it be, is in an inchoate and
unorganised condition. There is no critical edition of the
prose <i>Lancelot</i>; and as we shall see in the following
studies, not merely the <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>, but the numerous printed
editions derived from the <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>, differ so widely from each
other that until a critical text based on a comparison of
<i>all</i> the available versions is in our hands, it will be quite
impossible to do more than form a tentative hypothesis, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
advance a guarded suggestion as to the gradual growth and
formation of the completed legend.</p>

<p>I would therefore entreat any readers of this and the
subsequent chapters to bear in mind that I am not attempting
any critical study of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, as a
whole&mdash;the time for such a study has not yet come&mdash;but
rather I am examining (<i>a</i>) certain points of the prose
legend which are of capital importance in themselves, or
must have existed in some form even in a shorter version
of the story, <i>e.g.</i>, such as Lancelot's youth, and first appearance
at court, his relations with Guinevere, and connection
with the Grail story; (<i>b</i>) certain interesting variants in the
texts we possess, variants which are of the greatest importance
to English scholars as clearing up many of the
difficulties connected with the character of the source used
by Malory in his compilation.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> My aim is to prepare the
way for a critical examination of the prose <i>Lancelot</i> rather
than to myself offer such a critical examination.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I hazarded the suggestion that the
original germ of the whole story might prove to be a <i>lai</i>
recounting the theft of a child by a water-fairy, and in
spite of the unwieldy dimensions to which the tale has
grown, I think this suggestion will be found to hold
good.</p>

<p>As I hinted above, the <i>Lancelot</i> legend is not confined
to the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, but it has affected romances originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
entirely unconnected with our hero, such as the <i>Merlin</i>
and the <i>Tristan</i>. In the earliest forms of the story neither
of these tales have anything whatever to do with Lancelot;
in the latest versions <i>Tristan</i> has been practically incorporated
into the <i>Lancelot</i>, while <i>Merlin</i> forms an
elaborate introduction to it.</p>

<p>Though it has undergone a certain amount of modification,
the tradition at the base of the <i>Merlin</i> and prose <i>Lancelot</i>
appears to be identical with that related by the <i>Lanzelet</i>.
The names Ban of Benoic and Pant of Genewîs are quite
near enough to represent the same original, probably
modified in the <i>Lanzelet</i> by translation into another tongue.
The story of the king driven from his kingdom and dying
of a broken heart is the same, <i>au fond</i>, though the <i>motif</i>
has been varied, and in the prose <i>Lancelot</i> the king's
misfortunes are caused by treachery, and not by his own
misgovernment. This is a very natural modification, and
one likely to be caused by the growing popularity of the
son, which would have a tendency to react favourably on
the character of the father.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that both versions of the <i>Merlin</i> story know
the <i>Lancelot</i> legend in its completed form. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Vulgate <i>Merlin</i> knows of his two cousins, Lionel and
Bohort, whose introduction into the legend marks that
secondary stage, when not merely the hero, but the hero's
race in its entirety, is selected for special honour.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In the Ordinary, or Vulgate, <i>Merlin</i>, the enchanter is
never brought into direct contact with Lancelot, but is
betrayed to his doom before the birth of that hero takes
place. In the <i>Suite de Merlin</i>, however, he and his
treacherous love visit the castle of King Ban, and see the
child, whose future fame Merlin prophesies; while the
lady is identified with the fairy who brings up Lancelot.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Suite</i> also refers in a prophetic manner to certain
subsequent feats of Lancelot, and introduces the personages
of the <i>Tristan</i> story, such as Morholt (Le Morhout),<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
a clear proof that it is posterior to the incorporation of this
legend with the Arthurian cycle.</p>

<p>Of the two <i>Merlin</i> versions, the <i>Suite</i> therefore appears
to be the later, but the Vulgate <i>Merlin</i> also refers to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Grail romances,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> so that it seems clear that both have been
redacted subsequent to the completion of the <i>Lancelot</i>
story.</p>

<p>To return to the prose <i>Lancelot</i>. The story of the
hero's youth, while agreeing in the main with that told
by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, is yet marked by important
modifications and additions. The brothers Lionel and
Bohort appear on the scene, and become Lancelot's
companions, while the whole conception of the kingdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the Lady of the Lake is radically modified. It is no longer
a <i>Meide-lant</i>; Lancelot has knight-attendants as well as
cousin-playfellows, indeed, save for the <i>Mirage</i>, which
counterfeits a lake and thus keeps off unwelcome intruders,
the country is to all intents and purposes an ordinary
earthly kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>When the lad (who is always called by his protectress
<i>Fils du roi</i>, and has a more than adequate idea of his
own importance) leaves the kingdom, which he does in
order to seek knighthood at Arthur's hands, he goes
gorgeously equipped, with armour, steed, and retinue of
servants.</p>

<p>But his arrival at Arthur's court is most interesting and
suggestive. Arthur meets him without the town, and
consigns him to the care of <i>Ywain</i>, who, the next day,
leads him to the palace through a crowd of spectators
eager to look upon his beauty.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I have commented upon the
strong resemblance between the account of Lanzelet's
entry into the world, as described by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven,
and that of Parzival, as related by Wolfram von
Eschenbach. Both alike are ignorant of knightly skill and
customs; both are unable to control their steeds, they
cannot even hold the bridle; both are alike fair to look
upon, but apparently foolish (<i>tumbe</i>); both are ignorant of
their name and parentage. Different as the account of the
prose <i>Lancelot</i> is from this, and no difference could well
be wider, yet here again the <i>Lancelot</i> falls into line with
the <i>Perceval</i> story, and again in the form peculiar to
Wolfram von Eschenbach; for there, too, Parzival makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
his entry on foot, through a crowd eager to behold his
beauty, and his guide is the squire <i>Iwanet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that in Chrétien's version of the
story Perceval's entry is made under quite different circumstances.
He rides into the hall, and advances so close
to the king that his horse's head touches him, and subsequently
he refuses to dismount.</p>

<p>The correspondence of the name Ywain=Iwanet is also
significant. In the case of Wolfram's poem it has been
generally concluded that the name was a diminutive of
<i>Iwein</i> or <i>Iwan</i>, and therefore distinct from the name
Chrétien gives to Gawain's squire who aids Perceval to
disarm his fallen foe&mdash;<i>Yonet</i>. Hertz, in his recent translation
of the <i>Parzival</i>,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> takes this view, though he would
differentiate the Ywain referred to from King Urien's
famous son, and in my translation of the poem I adopted
the same view. But further study has led me to doubt
this solution. I now think it more probable that the name
is in both cases the same, <i>i.e.</i> a form of the Breton <i>Yonec</i>,
which we find with the varying spelling, <i>Iwenec</i> and <i>Yonet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Thus both Chrétien and Wolfram refer to the same
character; and the compiler of the prose <i>Lancelot</i> probably
knew the <i>Perceval</i> story under a form analogous rather to
Wolfram than to Chrétien. Whether the form <i>Ywain</i> was
adopted through a mistake, or from a desire to substitute a
well-known hero for an obscure squire, it is impossible to
say, in any case the correspondence, though less striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
than the similar passages of the <i>Lanzelet</i>, is worth
noting.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Again we find that Guinevere, failing to obtain an answer
from the youth, who is struck dumb by her beauty, makes
some contemptuous remarks as to his lack of sense, and
leaves the hall. This may be compared with <i>Parzival</i>,
Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> ll. 988-9.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>A further indication of contact with the <i>Perceval</i> romances
is afforded by the love-trances which overtake the hero at
the most inconvenient moment, and are repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>
in the most clumsy and inartistic manner. It is
noticeable that on the occasion of the first attack (in the
case of Lancelot one can only regard these trances as an
intermittent malady) the knight is clad in red armour and
leans on his spear&mdash;as does Perceval when he sees the
blood-drops on the snow. In the prose <i>Lancelot</i> it is
invariably the sight, and not the memory, of Guinevere
which causes the trance, a far less poetical conception than
that of the <i>Perceval</i>.</p>

<p>But in face of the passage quoted by M. Paulin Paris,
in his translation of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, probably few will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
contend that the story of <i>Perceval</i> was not anterior to, and
well-known by the compiler of, the first mentioned romance.
<i>Et le grant conte de Lancelot convient repairier en la fin à
Perceval qui est chiés et la fin de tos les contes ès autres
chevaliers. Et tout sont branches de lui, qu'il acheva la
grant queste. Et li contes Perceval meismes est une branche
del haut conte del Graal qui est chiés de tos les contes.</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>We should note here that when this particular passage
was written the writer evidently knew nothing of Galahad as
the Grail Winner, though he knew the <i>Lancelot</i> story in an advanced
stage. We shall have occasion to refer to this later on.</p>

<p>In the account of Lancelot's first appearance at court
we find an incident which appears to connect the story
with a cycle of poems bearing a curious resemblance to
the <i>Perceval</i> cycle&mdash;the <i>Bel Inconnu</i> poems. Immediately
after the hero has received knighthood, as they sit at
meat in the hall, a messenger arrives, sent by the 'Dame
de Nohan,'<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> asking for a champion to aid her against the
King of Northumberland. Lancelot (whose name we must
remember is not yet revealed, and who is referred to by
the compiler as <i>Le Beau Varlet</i>) at once requests that the
adventure be given to him, and, though Arthur demurs on
account of his youth and inexperience, insists that he
has a right to it, as the first boon he has claimed since he
was knighted.</p>

<p>It is under precisely similar circumstances that the hero
of the <i>Bel Inconnu</i> stories undertakes his first adventure.</p>

<p>Others have been struck by this resemblance, and M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Philipot, in his review of Dr. Schofield's <i>Studies on the
Libeaus Desconus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> maintains that the <i>Lancelot</i> story (more
particularly in the version known to Ulrich von Zatzikhoven)
is the elder of the two, and the source of the parallel
adventure of the <i>Bel Inconnu</i> group.</p>

<p>With this view I cannot agree. I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> given
reasons for holding the true order of the <i>Enfances</i> to be
as follows, <i>Perceval</i>, <i>Le Bel Inconnu</i>, <i>Lancelot</i>, and to this
view I adhere. We must remember that the French
original of the <i>Lanzelet</i> must in any case be prior to 1194;
how much earlier we have no means of deciding, but the
<i>Lanzelet</i> has points of contact with both the <i>Perceval</i>
(Enfances) and the <i>Bel Inconnu</i> (Fier Baiser) story.
Further, the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, though differing very widely
from Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's poem, yet, as we see, also
offers parallels both to <i>Perceval</i> and <i>Le Bel Inconnu</i>; such
parallels being entirely different from those of the <i>Lanzelet</i>.
To assert that these stories borrowed from the <i>Lancelot</i>
would involve the existence, at an early date, of a
fully developed and widely diffused <i>Lancelot</i> legend, a
conclusion which the absence of all reference to the hero
in the earlier Arthurian romances forbids.</p>

<p>To my mind, when we have three separate cycles of
romance closely connected with each other, if we desire to
discover which is the oldest of the stories we should ask in
the first instance, in which of the stories are the incidents
common to all the essence, in which are they the accidents,
of the tale. It is quite clear that they are not essential to
the <i>Lancelot</i> story. The characteristics of ignorance, simplicity,
and headlong impulsiveness attributed to him by
Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, are entirely foreign to his character
as elsewhere represented; even in the <i>Lanzelet</i> they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
promptly discarded: but they <i>are</i> the very essence of
Perceval's character, he, and no other, is the <i>schöne tumbe</i>
of romance. Again, the adventure of the <i>Fier Baiser</i> has
absolutely nothing to do with Lancelot; it is manifestly
dragged into the <i>Lanzelet</i> version 'by the head and
shoulders,' and has no connection with the context, but it
is the crown and completion of the adventures of Gawain's
nameless son.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Whatever be the connection between the <i>Perceval</i> and
<i>Bel Inconnu</i> stories, I think it is clear that both were well
known before the development of the <i>Lancelot</i> legend took
place, and that in the process of development this latter
borrowed from both. A close examination of the variants
of the <i>Lancelot</i> 'Enfances' will, I think, strengthen the
hypothesis advanced in a previous chapter, <i>i.e.</i> that the connection
of the hero with a water-fairy <i>alone</i> is of the essence
of the tale, all the rest is comparatively late in development,
and markedly <i>non</i>-original and secondary in character.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">THE PROSE LANCELOT&mdash;THE LOVES OF
LANCELOT AND GUINEVERE</p>


<p>In the previous chapter I remarked that the time, and the
material, for a really critical study of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>
were not yet ripe, and that I should, therefore, confine
myself to the discussion of the more striking features of the
story, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Enfances</i>, the <i>liaison</i> with Guinevere, and the
connection with the Grail Quest. These form what we
may call the persistent element in the completed <i>Lancelot</i>
legend; the great mass of adventures filling in the framework,
varying (as we shall presently see) so considerably,
that till we have some idea of the growth and various
redactions of the story it is hopeless to attempt to criticise
them.</p>

<p>Certain remarks, however, we can safely make. The
story as we have it at present is marked by a constant
repetition of similar incidents. I have already alluded to
one, the love-trance. What we may perhaps consider an
exaggeration of this <i>motif</i>, the love-madness, also occurs
more than once and has affected the <i>Tristan</i> story. This
is certainly not an original feature, but I think it is a
question whether the source be the <i>Chevalier au Lion</i> or
the <i>Prophecies of Merlin</i>; personally I incline to the latter
solution, and think the name of Merlin's wife, Guendolen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
may have suggested its introduction into the <i>Lancelot</i>
story.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Another incident of frequent repetition is the release of
the hero from prison in order that he may attend a tournament.
Of this we have at least three instances: the
version of the <i>Charrette</i>, where it is the wife of the
seneschal, his jailor, who assists him; and two belonging
specially to the prose <i>Lancelot</i>. In one instance it is from
the prison of the Dame de Malehault that he attends the
tournament and returns, as in the <i>Charrette</i>; in the other
he is freed from the prison of the three queens by the
daughter of the Duc de Rochedon, and does not return.
This latter also corresponds with his being freed from the
prison of Meleagant by the daughter of King Baudemagus,
whom Malory, doubtless under the influence of the
<i>Charrette</i> story, substitutes in his translation for the
heiress of Rochedon.</p>

<p>Again we find that certain adventures, some of considerable
importance, are related in some versions of the story
while they are omitted in others, but in the absence of a
critical and comparative edition it is impossible to say
which of the great mass of adventures now composing the
prose <i>Lancelot</i> belonged to the original redaction. Nor
can this again be satisfactorily settled till we have determined
the mutual relation between the <i>Grand S.
Graal</i>, the <i>Queste</i>, and the <i>Lancelot</i>. In short, the <i>Lancelot</i>
problem involves a number of minor problems of extreme
intricacy, and till these be solved we only stand on the
threshold of Arthurian criticism.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>A point in which it appears to me that we have a
suggestion of the original tale, expanded from a source
foreign to that tale, is in the account of the expedition
undertaken to recover Lancelot's ancestral kingdom from
the hands of King Claudas. There is no doubt that the
hero should, as a matter of poetical justice, regain his
inheritance, and in the <i>Lanzelet</i> we find it summarily
recorded that he does so,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> but under entirely different
circumstances from those recorded in the prose <i>Lancelot</i>.
The latter account is of extreme length, and apparently
a free imitation of the Arthurian expeditions of the
<i>Chronicles</i>; the incident of Frollo's defeat before Paris is
certainly borrowed from Geoffrey or his translators. As it
now stands the incident is lacking in point and practically
unnecessary to the story, since Lancelot prefers to continue
Arthur's knight rather than become a sovereign in his own
right, and therefore bestows the lands on his cousins and
bastard half-brother. The retention of a feature which
evolution has thus robbed of its significance appears to
afford evidence both of the original independence of the
tale and also of the priority of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's
version.</p>

<p>Leaving on one side then the minor adventures into
which the successive redactions have introduced considerable
variation, we will turn to that feature of the story
which, practically unvarying in form, appears to offer us
a fairer prospect of arriving at some real and definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
conclusion&mdash;the love of Lancelot for the wife of his liege
lord. Setting aside the many minor questions to which
the subject gives rise, it seems to me that the main
problem of the amours of Lancelot and Guinevere is, Do
they represent the latest form of an original feature of the
story, or are we to consider them as an addition to the
tale, an element imported into it under the influence of
the popular <i>Tristan</i> legend?</p>

<p>This much is certain, there is no literary evidence of
growth in the story; either it is non-existent, as in the
<i>Lanzelet</i>, or complete, fully developed, and decked out in
all the artificialities and refinements of <i>Minne-dienst</i>, as
in the <i>Charrette</i>. As we noted in our discussion of the
latter poem, Chrétien evidently credits his audience with
a previous knowledge of the relations between the queen
and his hero; he nowhere hints that he is about to tell
them something new, nor does he offer any explanation
why Lancelot rather than Gawain, who, as the <i>Merlin</i>
informs us, was 'the queen's knight,' should achieve the
rescue of his liege lady. There can be no doubt that he
was dealing with a situation thoroughly familiar to, and
understood by, his hearers.</p>

<p>A point which we are much tempted to overlook in the
criticism of Arthurian romance is the length of time intervening
between the period at which the events recorded are
supposed to have happened, and the earliest known literary
record of those events. If we estimate this intervening
period as five centuries, we are speaking well within the
mark. It is obvious that we have here ample time for
forgetfulness, dislocation, or rearrangement of the original
legend. Yet that that legend survived I hold for certain.
Had Arthur been completely forgotten, the immense popu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>larity
achieved by the romances of his cycle would constitute
a literary phenomenon practically unique; the seed
that in the twelfth century burst into such glorious flower
had been germinating for ages. The question is, what
was the nature of that seed&mdash;what the relation of the
original Arthurian legend to the completed Arthurian
romance?</p>

<p>On this point it behoves us to tread warily, and to avoid
dogmatising. I have suggested elsewhere that probably
the historic germ of the Arthurian legend is to be found
in his fights with the Saxons, his betrayal by his wife and
nephew, and his death in battle with the latter. Certainly
there is a genuine historic element in the account of
his wars; and it is significant that the older Arthurian
chroniclers&mdash;Geoffrey of Monmouth and his translators&mdash;all
agree in relating at considerable length the story of
Guinevere's betrayal of her husband; while the Welsh
tradition, which does not know Lancelot, is even more
emphatic on the subject of her infidelity.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>We must remember that, alike in Geoffrey, Wace, and
Layamon, the account of Guinevere's relations with Mordred
is totally different to that familiar to us through
Malory, and borrowed by him from the <i>Mort Artur</i>.
In the latter, the queen is no accomplice in Mordred's
treason, but resists his advances <i>vi et armis</i>, barricading
herself in the Tower of London, where the traitor vainly
besieges her.</p>

<p>In the chronicles the whole position is different: they
shall speak for themselves. This is Wace's account:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>In the corresponding passage, Geoffrey of Monmouth
gives as his authorities 'Breton' tradition and the clerk
Walter of Oxford (cf. note to above passage). Layamon
in his account is even more severe towards the guilty pair:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>

</div></div>

<p>In the passage corresponding to that quoted above from
Wace, Layamon adds the detail, that none knew the manner
of the queen's death, <i>whether she had drowned herself</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">'nuste hit mon to soðe.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">þa heo seolf weore<br /></span></i>
<span class="i0"><i>isunken in þe watere.</i>'&mdash;ll. 28481-85.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From these passages it is abundantly clear that Guinevere
was no victim of treachery, but a willing sinner; and
that the tradition of her infidelity to her husband existed
prior to the formation of the Arthurian romantic cycle.</p>

<p>Granting, then, that the feature formed part of the early
Arthurian legend, are we to consider that the version given
by the chronicles faithfully represents the original tradition,
and that it was Mordred who was Guinevere's original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
lover? I think not. It is an extremely curious feature
of the problem, that though in each of the pseudo-historic
versions Guinevere, as we have seen, is genuinely in love
with Mordred, and is roundly condemned by the chroniclers
for her conduct, in no single one of the Arthurian <i>romances</i>
is there any trace of the slightest affection existing between
them. Mordred, save as traitor in the final scenes, plays
no rôle in the story; he is never represented as a <i>persona
grata</i> at court; in one important version, as we shall see,
the queen dislikes him because she suspects his true relation
to Arthur. Guinevere's moral character is held to be
untarnished, even by her <i>liaison</i> with Lancelot.</p>

<p>I suspect that we have here to deal with a lapse of
tradition. Mordred is not the original lover, but he represents
him; and between that original lover and Lancelot
there intervenes a period in which Guinevere's lapse from
virtue was smoothed over, and partially forgotten. It is
certainly remarkable that in each of the three great prose
branches, the <i>Merlin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the <i>Tristan</i>, and the <i>Lancelot</i>, Guinevere's
moral character is apparently unaffected by her conduct
with Lancelot. The compilers all agree in extolling
her as the noblest of queens and best of women. Even
so aggressively virtuous and clerical a romance as the
prose <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>, though quite aware of the connection,
regards Guinevere in a favourable light&mdash;indeed,
as morally superior to Arthur! Nor can we quote the
<i>Queste</i> as representing the opposite view; true, Lancelot
is blamed for his relations with the queen, but Guinevere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
when she appears upon the scene, is treated with marked
respect, and the reader has an uncomfortable suspicion
that the writer objected to her rather as woman than as
wife,&mdash;he objects to the sex as a whole, only forgiving Perceval's
sister on account of her virginity. It seems clear
that if the character of Guinevere has, among the Welsh,
been handed down to posterity under the unfavourable light
in which Professor Rhys tells us she is popularly regarded,
this must be due <i>either</i> to a tradition emanating from an
earlier and healthier state of society, when conjugal infidelity
was not regarded with complacency, <i>or</i> to a later and more
enlightened verdict on her relations with Lancelot, but in
no case can it be due to the influence of those who told
the story of these relations.</p>

<p>The second cause will, I think, account for the nineteenth-century
presentment of Guinevere's character; we
judge her on the grounds of her relations with Lancelot,
which we regard as blameworthy, though not undeserving
of sympathy&mdash;in fact, we do but emphasise Malory's
verdict.</p>

<p>But this does not account for the Welsh tradition,
which, as I have before pointed out, knows practically
nothing of Lancelot; that must rest upon other grounds,
and I believe it rests upon the tradition preserved to us in
the Mordred story.</p>

<p>What this original tradition was, we can now only surmise;
it belonged to a period of which but few and fragmentary
traces survive, but I think that most probably the
primitive story ascribed the rôle of lover to Gawain. I
made this suggestion some four years ago,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and subsequent
study has shown me nothing to induce me to alter my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
opinion, though it has suggested sundry important modifications.</p>

<p>I think now that Gawain and Mordred really represent
the two sides of one original personality; and that a
personality very closely connected with early Celtic
tradition.</p>

<p>What the exact nature of the relation between Gawain
and early Irish mythic tradition may be we cannot yet say:
that such a relation exists is practically beyond doubt.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Among the characteristic features of the early Irish
heroes with whom Gawain is connected, we find the following:
Adventurous hero and nephew on the female
side to royal centre of cycle (Cuchulinn and Diarmid<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>);
son to that uncle (Cuchulinn); lover of uncle's wife, eloping
with her (Diarmid); deadly combat between father and
son (Cuchulinn and Conlaoch). This latter incident I
believe to be of greater importance in heroic-mythic
tradition than has yet been realised. As I interpret it,
the father and son combat in heroic tradition really represents
the 'slayer who shall himself be slain,' the prehistoric
combat of the '<i>Golden Bough</i>' (to which I have referred in
chap. v.) influenced by the doctrine of re-birth, as set
forth by Mr. Nutt in vol. ii. of the <i>Voyage of Bran</i>, <i>i.e.</i> it is
a conflict of the god with his re-born and re-juvenated self,
and as such has a very real place in Celtic tradition.</p>

<p>As we see above, we do not at present possess a version
in which all these characteristics are united in one hero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
but they might very well be so united. I think that the
earlier Gawain was at once Arthur's nephew and son by
his sister,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> adventurous hero of the court, lover of the
queen, and eventually slayer of his father-uncle.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Very probably in the original story there was some such
device as the beauty-spot of Diarmid, which aroused involuntary
passion in every woman who beheld him; or the
love-potion of the Tristan story; a device whereby the
earlier tellers of these tales secured sympathy for the
lovers, without lowering the character of the husband, so
that Gawain, no less than Diarmid and Tristan, would be
regarded as a gallant and sympathetic figure.</p>

<p>But the peculiar line of evolution followed by the
Arthurian story, the strongly ethical and Christian character
which it early assumed (due probably to the heathen belief
of the historic Arthur's genuine antagonists, the Saxons),
made a change necessary, if Gawain was to preserve his
position as leading hero of the legend, and I now think it
most probable that that change was effected by divesting
Gawain of the characteristics incompatible with his later
position, and bestowing them on another personality,
created for the purpose, since they could not altogether
be dropped out of the story. It is significant that, as I
remarked above, the earliest tradition gives Gawain no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
brother save Mordred, and Layamon remarks emphatically,
'<i>he never had any other</i>.'</p>

<p>Further, I suspect, that exactly the same process took
place with regard to Guinevere, and that we have a survival
of it in the person of that mysterious lady, the false
Guinevere.</p>

<p>I would therefore modify my original views on the subject,
by saying that I now think that though Gawain was
Guinevere's original lover, Lancelot did not succeed him in
that rôle, in fact that Lancelot does not represent the
original lover at all, that that tradition is now represented
by the Mordred story, and that there was a period in the
evolution of the legend, preceding the introduction of
Lancelot into the cycle, during which the tradition of
Guinevere's voluntary betrayal of her husband was dropped,
and she was regarded in an altogether favourable light.</p>

<p>The invention of the Lancelot love-story, which I think
we must regard as in its origin an invention, was probably
brought about by two causes, the growth of <i>Minne-dienst</i>,
and the popularity of the <i>Tristan</i> story.</p>

<p>To be absolutely accurate, I think we ought to consider
it as <i>invented</i> to satisfy the demands of the first, and
<i>developed</i> under the influence of the second. That it is, as
some writers have held, a mere imitation of the <i>Tristan</i>
story, I do not think, rather it is marked by certain complex
characteristics which cannot be explained on the
hypothesis of other than a dual source. Thus it is impossible
not to feel that the relations of the lovers are dictated
by the rules of a conventional etiquette rather than by the
impulse of an overmastering passion. Even in the scene
in which Lancelot first reveals his love to the queen, there
is no touch of genuine passion or self-abandonment; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
confession has been foreseen and expected, and you feel
that Guinevere has carefully regulated her conduct in
accordance with the etiquette prescribed for such an
occasion.</p>

<p>In the <i>Charrette</i>, this artificial character is strongly
marked; Lancelot's bearing becomes absolutely grovelling
in its humility. The fact that he has been guilty of a
momentary hesitation before mounting the cart is regarded
by his capricious lady as a deadly offence against the rules
of love, and resented accordingly, while Lancelot is so
overcome by the assumed indifference of the queen that he
promptly attempts suicide. Compare this with the story of
Gawain and Orgeluse in the <i>Parzival</i>. Gawain is heartily
in love with the lady, who treats him, not merely with indifference,
but with absolute insolence&mdash;insolence to which
Gawain opposes the most serene and unruffled courtesy, till
the lady comes to her senses, when he reads her a well-deserved
lecture on the correct behaviour due to a knight
from a well-bred lady. Gawain is quite as well aware of
the rules of the game as Lancelot, but understands how to
play it with becoming dignity, and remain master of the
situation.</p>

<p>There are moments in the Lancelot-Guinevere story
when one wonders whether the whole business be not as
platonic and artificial as the love-rhapsodies of the would-be
poets of mediæval Italy, or of certain of the troubadours;
but the night interview in the <i>Charrette</i>, the story
of Lancelot's relations with King Pelles's daughter, and
Guinevere's frantic jealousy, together with the final scene of
discovery, forbid this charitable assumption.</p>

<p>Again, as I remarked above, the problem is complicated
by the high character ascribed to Guinevere, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
absolute lack of any real condemnation of her relations
with Lancelot. This is carried so far that even after the
final discovery the kingdom of Britain is threatened by the
Pope with an interdict unless Arthur will consent to take
back his faithless wife; while throughout the war with
Lancelot the sympathies of the reader are asked for the
knight, not for the king. Nothing could well be lower
than the morality of the <i>Lancelot</i> story as it now stands:
the cynical indifference of what we may call the 'secular'
sections, on the one hand, coupled with the false and wholly
sickly pseudo-morality of the Grail sections on the other,
cannot but be utterly distasteful to any healthy mind. For
my own part, I must needs think the immense popularity
of the <i>Lancelot-Grail</i> romances wholly undeserved.</p>

<p>Another point which is often overlooked is the discrepancy
of age between Lancelot and the queen; the
hero's birth takes place some considerable time after the
marriage of Arthur and Guinevere. In the final war with
Arthur we are told that Lancelot is twenty-one years
Gawain's junior, this latter being seventy,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> while Arthur is
ninety years old! It is quite clear that we have here no
tale of the genuine spontaneous love of youth and maiden
such as we find in Tristan and Iseult, but rather the
account of the <i>liaison</i> between a young knight and a lady,
his superior in years and station.</p>

<p>All these discrepancies and difficulties in the <i>Lancelot</i>
story can, I believe, be best explained on the lines above
suggested. The original story of Guinevere's infidelity had
been dropped out of the legend, a reminiscence only
surviving in the account of Mordred's treachery. Shortly
after the middle of the twelfth century the tone given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
courtly society by certain influential princesses, among
them Eleanor of Aquitaine and England, and her daughter,
Marie de Champagne, demanded the introduction into the
popular Arthurian story of a love element, conceived after
the conventions of the day. Doubtless the popularity of
the older <i>Tristan</i> story was an element in the matter, but
we must, I think, guard carefully against regarding the one
as an imitation of the other; in colouring and characteristics
the tales are, as I said above, diametrically opposed.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Why Lancelot was selected as the queen's lover is a
question which it is extremely difficult to answer with any
certainty. When I treated the subject in my <i>Legend of
Sir Gawain</i>, I suggested that he simply took the place of
Gawain here, as elsewhere. That may have been the case,
but the fact that, as I now think, we have distinct evidence
of an intervening period, or rather of intervening stages,
between the stories, somewhat militates against this idea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The choice may have been determined by quite simple
considerations. It is noticeable that in each of the poems
in which Chrétien mentions Lancelot previous to the
<i>Charrette</i> he places him third in the list of Arthur's
knights; in <i>Erec</i> the two first are Gawain and Erec; in
<i>Cligés</i> they are Gawain and Perceval. None of the three
here named would be available: Gawain from his relationship
alike to Arthur and to Mordred, besides the fact that
the character he early acquired as 'the Maidens' Knight'
rather militated against the exclusive fidelity requisite for
the post; Erec was already provided with a lady-love;
Perceval was impracticable, not so much from the ascetic
character ascribed to him, which was probably<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> a later
accretion, as from his essentially uncourtly manners, and
very slight connection with Arthur's household. It may
very well be that at the 'psychological moment' Lancelot,
by his new-won position in the cycle, was the one hero who
approved himself fitted for the rôle, and thus reached in
the character of the queen's lover his final evolution as an
Arthurian knight.</p>

<p>Again, as I suggested in discussing the <i>Lanzelet</i>, it may
be that some peculiarity in his relations with his mysterious
protectress gave the required suggestion. With the knowledge
at our disposal the question cannot be definitely
answered.</p>

<p>But the central idea once conceived, the process of
evolution proceeded merrily: doubts, hesitation, despondency,
on the part of the hero, gracious advances on that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the queen; advances on the part of other ladies, jealousy on
the part of Guinevere; despair and madness of Lancelot;
reconciliation, suspicion, detection, danger, deliverance,
all the well-known formulæ of such a love-tale are employed,
well interspersed with the knightly adventures of
Lancelot and other companions of the Round Table.
Such a story could be expanded, <i>ad infinitum</i>, and there
is no doubt that it was expanded to an inordinate length,
as we shall find when the day comes for a critical edition
of the various redactions of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of the romance which had given the
initial impulse to the formation of the Lancelot story, the
<i>Tristan</i>? As a matter of fact the <i>Tristan</i> was in the unenviable
position of a Frankenstein. It had created, or
rather helped to create, a monster which was its eventual
destruction. So far as incidents go, the <i>Lancelot</i> has
borrowed but little from the <i>Tristan</i>; the episode of the
blood-drops, which betray the nocturnal meeting of Guinevere
and Lancelot in the <i>Charrette</i>, is generally admitted
to be borrowed from the similar episode in the <i>Tristan</i>
poems, while the version given by Hartmann von Aue
of the abduction of Guinevere shows points of contact
with that of Iseult by Gandîn, but the incidental parallels
between the stories are in reality very slight. Turn, however,
to the prose <i>Tristan</i>, and you find the influence
of the <i>Lancelot</i> absolutely dominant. Following the
example of Lancelot, Tristan believes himself to have lost
the favour of his adored queen, flies to the woodland,
where he goes mad; attempts suicide; Iseult pours out
her woes in letters to Guinevere, who is regarded as the
noblest of queens, and a recognised authority on love!
Guinevere invites the lovers to Arthur's court; Lancelot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
places his castle of Joyous Garde at their disposal. The
details of the beautiful old love poem, the poignant tragedy
of Tristan and Iseult, are lost sight of. In a fragmentary
form they still exist, but are buried out of sight underneath
the great mass of Arthurian accretion. It is no longer the
love of Tristan for Iseult which is the central interest of
the story, but the rivalry between Tristan and Lancelot,
which of the two shall be reckoned 'the best knight in
the world.'</p>

<p>Dr. Wechssler, in his study on the various redactions of
the Lancelot-Grail cycle, points out the manner in which
the two versions of the <i>Tristan</i> have been worked over and
modified so as to bring them more into harmony with the
<i>Lancelot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> But how thoroughgoing was this modification,
and how disastrous to the older story, can only be understood
by a first-hand study of the texts. An interesting point
for future criticism to determine will be whether there was
ever an earlier, and independent, prose <i>Tristan</i>, or whether
the prose versions of this tale are not all posterior to and
dependent upon the <i>Lancelot</i>. I do not think that any
question can here arise as to the priority of the poetical
relative to the prose form.</p>

<p>To sum up the conclusions arrived at in these pages, I
would suggest that the order of Guinevere's lovers, so far
as can be determined from the surviving Arthurian tradition,
was as follows:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Gawain.</span>&mdash;This being indicated by Gawain's close
connection with kindred Celtic legends; traces of the
relation surviving in the accounts given in the <i>Merlin</i>
of Gawain as the 'queen's knight,' and in passages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Chrétien's <i>Perceval</i>, Wolfram's <i>Parzival</i>, and early English
romances.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Mordred.</span>&mdash;Representing a period when such a
relationship was held incompatible with Gawain's character
as chivalrous hero, and the more unamiable features of the
primitive conception were transferred to another character
who was regarded as Gawain's only brother. The later
stages of this period are preserved in the <i>Chronicles</i>.</p>

<p>3. Intervening period wherein Guinevere undergoes
same process as Gawain, and false Guinevere is evolved.
The queen's character is regarded as irreproachable and
Mordred as an unwelcome suitor. Strong traces of this
period remain, both in the earlier metrical and prose
romances, and complicate the subsequent presentment.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Lancelot.</span>&mdash;His introduction in this character being
due (<i>a</i>) to social conditions in courtly circles, (<i>b</i>) to desire
to create within the Arthurian cycle a love-tale which should
rival in popularity the well-known and independent <i>Tristan</i>
story. Mordred, however, remains in the story, and he,
rather than Lancelot, should be considered as representing
the original 'infidelity-motif.'<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">THE PROSE LANCELOT&mdash;LANCELOT AND THE GRAIL</p>


<p>We now approach the most difficult and complicated part
of an exceptionally difficult and complicated question;
rather, to be more accurate, we are now confronted with
the union of two questions, each of them, in a high degree,
intricate and obscure. We have not yet succeeded in
solving the problems connected with the evolution of the
Grail romances; we can scarcely be said to have begun
the examination of the <i>Lancelot</i> legend; the union of the
two might well appear to present such insuperable difficulties
that the critic might shrink from grappling at close quarters
with so formidable a task. And yet it may well be that
this union of the two legends, which at the first glance
appears so seriously to increase our difficulties, is precisely
that factor which shall play the most important part in
their final solution; that inasmuch as the <i>Lancelot</i> legend
was the dominant factor in the later cyclic development of
Arthurian romances, the disentangling of this particular
thread will be the clue which sets free the other members
of the cycle, and enables them to fall once more into their
original and relative positions.</p>

<p>The elements composing the Grail problem are so well
known that here I need do no more than briefly recapitulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
them. The Grail romances are practically divided into
two families: that dealing with the history of the relic&mdash;the
<i>Early History</i> romances as they are very generally
called; and that dealing with the search for the relic, the
<i>Queste</i>, which latter family is again sharply divided into
two sections differentiated from each other by the personality
of the hero&mdash;the Perceval and Galahad <i>Questes</i>. I am
not sure whether we ought not to go a step further and
recognise a third clearly defined family, that of the Gawain
<i>Queste</i>. Mr. Nutt in his <i>Studies on the Legend of the Holy
Grail</i><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> partly recognises this, but does not, I think, attribute
sufficient importance to the matter, regarding Gawain as an
understudy of Perceval. I incline to think that before the
question is finally solved we shall require to study very
closely the variants which regard Gawain as Grail hero,
and compare them with the <i>Perceval</i> versions. I am not
sure that we shall find the result quite what we expect!</p>

<p>So far criticism has confined itself to the question of
the relation existing between the <i>Early History</i> and <i>Queste</i>
versions, and that between the two main families of the
<i>Queste</i>. In this latter case the general consensus of opinion
is to regard Perceval, whose story is marked by certain
definite and widely spread folk-lore features, as an earlier
Grail hero than Galahad, whose <i>Queste</i> is strongly allegorising
and mystical in character.</p>

<p>It is this latter <i>Queste</i> which here mainly concerns us,
but we shall find that before we are in a position to
examine it closely we must deal with certain features both
of the Gawain and Perceval variants.</p>

<p>The <i>Gawain</i> versions will not detain us long. There is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
correctly speaking, no definite <i>Gawain-Grail</i> romance, but
we find records of Gawain's visits to the Grail castle
scattered throughout the latter part of the <i>Conte del Graal</i>,
<i>Diu Krône</i> (where he is really the Grail hero), prose
<i>Lancelot</i>, and Dutch <i>Lancelot</i> (this latter, as we shall see,
differing in very important particulars from the prose
<i>Lancelot</i>). In each case these adventures are marked by
peculiarly wild and fantastic features, sometimes apparently
borrowed from the hero's feats at the <i>Château Merveil</i>, as
recorded by Chrétien and Wolfram, sometimes entirely
independent of those feats, but strongly reminiscent of
Perceval's experiences in the Grail castle. In the distinctively
<i>Lancelot</i> romances, where Gawain, Lancelot, and Bohort
all attempt the adventures of Corbenic, Gawain is the first
to do so, and his experiences are repeated, with a more
fortunate result, in the case of the other two. The <i>Grand
S. Graal</i>, which gives an account of the founding of
Corbenic, and the establishment of its marvels, states that
none are to escape with their lives till <i>Gawain</i> shall come,
and he shall receive shame and dishonour.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> This same
romance makes Gawain a descendant of Joseph of
Arimathea.</p>

<p>I think it is quite clear that the Grail castle as depicted
in the later romances is really a combination of the features
of two originally distinct accounts, the Grail castle of the
earlier Perceval story, and the <i>Château Merveil</i> of Gawain
legend. The marvellous features which the Galahad-Lancelot
<i>Queste</i> emphasises have clearly been borrowed
from the Gawain romances, and are therefore to be considered
as younger than these.</p>

<p>Dr. Wechssler's study, <i>Über die verschiedenen Redaktionen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
des Robert von Borron zugeschriebenen Graal-Lancelot-Cyklus</i>,
to which I have previously referred, is of value
in helping us to the next stage of our investigation. The
writer points out that the redactors of the prose romances
we possess were familiar with two compilations, practically
covering the entire ground of Arthurian romance, one of
which, the earlier, was ascribed to Robert de Borron, the
other, the later, to Walter Map; or rather, as the author is
careful to write throughout, <i>pseudo</i>-Borron and <i>pseudo</i>-Map.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
The original cycle, which the writer designates <i>A.</i>,
consisted of <i>Livre del Graal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> <i>Merlin</i>, <i>Suite Merlin</i>, <i>Lancelot</i>,
<i>Queste</i>, and <i>Mort Artur</i>, but only traces of the <i>Borron</i>
cycle remain, the romances as we have them belonging to
the pseudo-<i>Map</i> redaction.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Further, Dr. Wechssler claims to have detected clear
traces of two subsidiary cycles formed by selections from
the original; redaction <i>B.</i> consisting of the <i>Livre del Graal</i>,
the <i>Merlin</i>, and <i>Suite Merlin</i>, and the <i>Queste</i> and <i>Mort
Artur</i>. The redaction <i>B.</i> he considers the earlier shortened
version of the pseudo-Borron cycle.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>A still later and shortened redaction was composed of
the <i>Merlin</i> and <i>Suite Merlin</i>, <i>Queste</i> and <i>Mort Artur</i>;
this also being attributed to the pseudo-Borron.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>According to Dr. Wechssler the distinguishing mark
which separates the pseudo-Borron from the pseudo-Map
cycle is the introduction into the former of the personages
of the <i>Tristan</i> legend absent from the Map cycle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>This is very clear, and very interesting, but let us wait a
minute before we examine it, and see how, in the hands of
its own author, the theory works out. The study to which
I have just referred was published in 1895; in 1898 another
study appeared from the same pen, this time dealing exclusively
with the Grail romances,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> in which Dr. Wechssler
practically adopted the standpoint of Professor Birch-Hirschfeld,
that the Grail is <i>ab initio</i> a Christian symbol,
but at the same time endeavoured to harmonise this view
with that which regards the Grail as originally a heathen
talisman, while, in the same way, he claimed to discover a
<i>viâ media</i> between the conflicting variants of the <i>Queste</i>,
presenting us, as the result, with a curious composite hero,
who was named Galahad, but whose story was the story of
Perceval.</p>

<p>I do not know if the author was himself really satisfied
with the result of his ingenuity; I am convinced no other
student of the Grail romances was; but the interest of the
study for us lies in this, how did a scholar who three years
before had published a really sound, solid, and valuable
piece of criticism, such as that on the Grail-Lancelot
cycle, come to wander so far astray in the quagmire of
pure hypothesis and unfounded assumption? Simply and
solely, I believe, because it had never occurred to Dr.
Wechssler that the <i>Lancelot</i> romances <i>could</i> be associated
with any <i>Queste</i> other than the Galahad <i>Queste</i>. He saw,
and saw rightly, that the <i>Lancelot</i> story played a very
important rôle in the cyclic evolution of the Arthurian
romance; he saw that it was closely connected with a
Grail <i>Queste</i>, and never suspecting that the hero of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<i>Queste</i> could be other than Galahad, while at the same
time he recognised the priority of certain elements of the
Perceval story, he endeavoured, with a fatal result, to
combine the two, and evolve such a <i>Queste</i> as would suit
the earlier redaction of the <i>Lancelot</i> story.</p>

<p>And yet the key to the truth was in his hand all the
time, had he but known it. He knew M. Paulin Paris's
'<i>Romans de la Table Ronde</i>'; on p. 87 of vol. iv. the
writer quotes a passage from a <span class="smcap">MS.</span> of the <i>Bibliothèque
Nationale</i>, to which I have previously referred, but which is
of such paramount importance for the question before us
that I make no apology for repeating it here: '<i>Et le grant
conte de Lancelot convient repairier en la fin à Perceval qui
est chiés et la fin de tos les contes ès autres chevaliers</i>. <i>Et
tout sont branches de lui</i> (c'est-à-dire se rapportent à
Perceval<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>) <i>qu'il acheva li grant queste. Et li contes
Perceval meismes est une branche del haut conte del Graal
qui est chiés de tos les contes</i>' (<span class="smcap">MS.</span> 751, fol. 144-48).</p>

<p>To this quotation M. Paulin Paris added the remark, 'Mais
dans la <i>Quête du Saint Graal</i>, Perceval n'est plus le héros
qui découvre le Graal et accomplit les dernières aventures.
Galaad, le chevalier vierge, fils naturel de Lancelot, est
substitué au <i>Perceval</i> des dernières laisses de Lancelot. La
manie des prolongements aura conduit à ces modifications
des premières conceptions. Et c'est la difficulté de distinguer
ces retouches successives qui a donné à la critique
tant de fils à retordre.'</p>

<p>The position could scarcely be more clearly stated to-day;
one can only regret that this luminous hint of the great
French scholar should have remained so long unfruitful.
When the passage first attracted my attention, which it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
some years ago, I made a note of it as important for the
theory of the early evolution of the <i>Perceval</i> story, but not
till I had read Dr. Wechssler's study of the <i>Grail-Lancelot</i>
cycles did its immense importance as evidence for the
evolution of the Arthurian cycle, as a whole, dawn upon me.
Yet here we have a piece of evidence of the very highest
value, a direct and categorical statement that at one period,
and that an advanced one (otherwise it would not be
termed 'le <i>grant</i> conte'), of its evolution, the <i>Lancelot</i>
legend was connected with and subordinate to the <i>Perceval</i>
story, and that in its full and complete Grail-Queste
form.</p>

<p>In other words, the distinction between the cycles respectively
attributed to Borron and to Map is not only the
presence or absence of the personages of the <i>Tristan</i> story
(as Dr. Wechssler supposes), but the much more important
and radical distinction that, in the first the <i>Queste</i> was
originally a Perceval, in the second always a Galahad <i>Queste</i>.
It is surprising that this distinction had not occurred to
the original framer of the thesis, any one familiar with the
genuine Borron romances must be aware that the <i>Queste</i>
they presuppose <i>is</i> a Perceval <i>Queste</i>. Probably the disinclination,
to which I have referred above, to connect
Lancelot with any Grail hero save his own son had very
much to do with the matter; further, I do not think that
Dr. Wechssler had formed a clear idea of the process of
evolution of the cycle he postulated, which he represents
as progressing by contraction, <i>i.e.</i> the earliest form being
the fullest, or why that cycle should have been connected
with the name of Robert de Borron. In fact, he reserves
the discussion of the questions concerning original formation
for another study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I would submit that the rational progress of
evolution is by expansion, not by contraction, and that
the name of Robert de Borron became associated with a
cycle representing the <i>ensemble</i> of Arthurian romance because
there was a smaller cycle which was really the work
of the genuine Robert de Borron, which smaller cycle
formed the germ of the later and more extended body of
romance.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Scholars have long ago recognised that the three works
attributed to Robert de Borron, and which, as we possess
them, probably represent prose versions of that writer's
original poems, are closely connected with each other, and
have every appearance of having been intended to form
one consecutive work. These three are the <i>Joseph of
Arimathea</i>, <i>Merlin</i>, and <i>Perceval</i>, which latter is only represented
by one <span class="smcap">MS.</span> and is what we generally call the 'Didot'
<i>Perceval</i>.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Now if we examine the Didot <i>Perceval</i>, as printed by
Mr. Hucher in vol. i. of <i>Le Saint Graal</i>, we shall find that
the last twenty pages, succeeding Perceval's achievement
of the Grail Quest, are devoted to Arthur's expedition to
France, his conquest of Frollo and war with Rome, succeeded
by Mordred's treachery, the final battle and Arthur's
departure for Avalon&mdash;in fact, precisely the contents of the
<i>Mort Artur</i>, which, as we know, generally follows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<i>Queste</i>, only related in a more concise and summary
manner;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and one more in accordance with the <i>Chronicles</i>
than is the case with the other prose romances.</p>

<p>I think it is quite clear that the <i>Perceval</i>, whether in the
original form in which Borron wrote it or not, as we possess
it, shows distinct traces of having formed the concluding
portion of a cycle.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that a genuine Borron cycle, such as
suggested above, would contain the germ of later expansion.
Thus the <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i> certainly appears to
represent what we may perhaps call the first draft of the
<i>Grand S. Graal</i>. <i>Merlin</i> was certainly expanded into the
<i>Merlin</i> Vulgate and <i>Suite</i>. <i>Perceval</i> represents <i>Queste</i> and
<i>Mort Artur</i>. Only the <i>Lancelot</i> is unrepresented, and with
that I do not think the original 'Borron' cycle had anything
to do.</p>

<p>The introduction of the <i>Lancelot</i> probably belongs, as
Dr. Wechssler suggests, to a subsequent writer, who borrowed
the more famous name, to the pseudo-Borron; and
from the quotation given by M. Paulin Paris, I should
think it likely that, at first, the juxtaposition of the <i>Lancelot</i>
and <i>Perceval-Grail</i> stories was purely external, and that
they did not affect each other by contamination. The
Didot <i>Perceval</i> may well have been the <i>Queste</i> of the
earliest pseudo-Borron, whether or not it represents the
<i>Queste</i> of the genuine Borron cycle.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>But the growing popularity of the <i>Lancelot</i> story would
render such a contamination inevitable, and I am strongly
tempted to believe that in that perplexing romance, the
prose <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>, we have the <i>Queste</i> of a later
pseudo-Borron cyclic redaction. The perplexing features
of this version are well known: the whole tone is highly
ecclesiastic, there are numerous references to an earlier
Perceval story, Lancelot plays an important rôle, yet
Galahad is unknown, and there are certain mysterious folk-lore
features not met with elsewhere. Hitherto no one has
succeeded in satisfactorily placing this romance. I would
suggest that it represents the <i>Queste</i> of a late pseudo-Borron
<i>Lancelot-Perceval-Grail</i> cycle; and I am encouraged in
this supposition by the fact that this romance knows the
Questing-Beast, a mysterious creation only found in the
<i>Suite Merlin</i> and the <i>Tristan Palamedes</i> romances. Now
the <i>Suite Merlin</i> claims to be by Robert de Borron, and
the introduction of the <i>Tristan</i> figures into the Arthurian
story is, as we saw above, held by Dr. Wechssler to be the
distinctive 'note' of the Borron-cycle.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>This conclusion is further strengthened when we examine
the rôle assigned to Lancelot in these two romances.
In each case he is one of the most distinguished knights at
Arthur's court, but he is much less <i>en évidence</i> in the Didot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<i>Perceval</i> than in the <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>. In the first-named
romance he is represented as overthrowing all the
knights of the Round Table, till the appearance of Perceval,
by whom he is himself overthrown. He would thus
appear to rank next to the hero of the tale and to be the
superior of Gawain. So far as we can gather, the order of
superiority runs thus: Perceval, Lancelot, Gawain, Yvain.
But he is, apparently, not of those who start on the Grail
quest; nor is there any indication of his <i>liaison</i> with
Guinevere. But the author mentions among the knights
'<i>le fiz à la fille à la femme de Malehot</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> We do not know
the lady of Malehault save through the medium of the
prose <i>Lancelot</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Perceval li Gallois</i> (<i>Perlesvaus</i> Professor Heinzel
prefers to call it), Lancelot is one of the three best knights
in the world, the other two being Perceval and Gawain;
he takes part in the Grail quest, but on account of his
sinful relations with Guinevere is not worthy to behold the
sacred talisman, which does not appear, even in a veiled
form, during his stay at the Fisher King's castle, whereas it
appears clearly to Gawain. The position, so far as Lancelot
is concerned, is thus nearer to the presentment of the
Galahad <i>Queste</i> than is the Didot <i>Perceval</i>. This last-named,
we have seen above, shows clear indications of betraying a
cyclic redaction; these indications, though differing in
form, are not less clear in the <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>. The
concluding passage runs thus: '<i>Après iceste estoire commence
li contes si comme Brians des Illes guerpi le roi Artus
por Lancelot que il n'aimoit mie et comme il aséura le roi
Claudas qui le roi Ban de Bénoic toli sa terre. Si parole cis

Galobrus de la Vermeille lande vint à la cort le roi Artus
por aidier Lancelot, quas il estoit de son lignage cist contes
est mout lons et mout aventreus et poisanz.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>In quoting this passage, Professor Heinzel remarks:
'Auch der <i>Perlesvaus</i> ist einem grösseren Romanwerk
einverleibt, aus dem die Handschrift von Mons den
<i>Perlesvaus</i> ausgeschrieben hat. Was ihm folgte muss eine
Art <i>Lancelot</i> gewesen sein.'<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>There is a further and interesting possibility before us.
The compilers may&mdash;in one instance, I think, we can show
reason to believe that they did&mdash;have incorporated the
Chrétien <i>Perceval</i> (or a version closely akin to it) into
their cycles as representing the <i>Queste</i>.</p>

<p>In the work of preparing these studies I felt that I ought
to leave no available version of the <i>Lancelot</i> unexplored,
and therefore undertook to read carefully the immense
compilation generally known as the Dutch <i>Lancelot</i>. Well
was it for me that I did not shrink from the task! I had
not read far before I began to suspect that the text repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>sented
by this translation was, in every respect, a fuller
and a better text than that used by Dr. Sommer in his
Malory collation; in the <i>Queste</i> section in particular was
this the case. In the succeeding chapters I intend to go
fully into what is, I believe, in the interests of Arthurian
criticism, a very important discovery. Here I will only
say that I eventually found that the text of the Dutch
<i>Lancelot</i>, of the printed version of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>
Lenoire, 1533 (which, as I have remarked before, Dr.
Sommer does not chronicle), and Malory's <i>Lancelot</i> and
<i>Queste</i> sections all stand together as representing a much
fuller and more accurate text than that of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>
1513, or the <i>Queste</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> consulted by Dr. Furnivall for his
edition of that romance. Whether we have not here an
important part of the <i>un</i>shortened pseudo-Borron-<i>Lancelot</i>
into which the Map <i>Queste</i> has been introduced is a matter
for careful investigation. The point to which at the present
moment I would draw attention is, that the Dutch
<i>Lancelot</i> incorporates a very considerable section of a
<i>Perceval</i> romance, which bears a very close resemblance to
Chrétien's poem, with this curious difference, that it gives
an account of the achieving of the adventures named by
the Grail messenger, which, so far as I know, is found nowhere
else. This section, which occupies over two thousand
lines, demands a special study, but for us its significance
lies in this that it seems to point to the conclusion that in
the evolution of a <i>Lancelot-Perceval</i> cycle (the existence of
which I think we may hold for proven) the compilers
allowed themselves considerable latitude in the <i>Queste</i>
section. There were several Perceval <i>Questes</i> to select
from, and they took which they preferred, even pressing the
original, manifestly independent, <i>Perceval</i> romances into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
their service. I suspect that this variation in the Perceval
<i>Queste</i> helped towards its suppression in favour of the
Galahad variant, which had the advantage of existing only
in one form, though the cause mainly operating was an
entirely different one.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>So far then we have traced the evolution of the <i>Lancelot</i>
story, and found that at one period of its development,
and that an advanced period, it was connected with a Grail
story, which regarded Perceval as its hero and knew
nothing of Lancelot's son, Galahad. How then did the
latter appear upon the scene, and in what light are we to
regard the romances dealing with him?</p>

<p>I have studied the Galahad <i>Queste</i> closely, and have
compared versions gathered from widely different sources,
French originals, and translations, and I am distinctly of
the opinion that we possess the romance practically in its
original form. It is a homogeneous composition, it is not
a compilation from different sources and by different
hands. There is no trace of an earlier and later redaction,
save only in the directly edifying passages, which in
some cases appear to have undergone amplification. The
difference between the versions is not that of incident or
sequence, scarcely even of detail, but rather of the superior
clearness and coherence with which the incidents are related
in some of the versions as compared with others. I am
strongly inclined to think that there is no peculiarity in
any of the <i>Queste</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> which cannot quite well be ascribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to the greater or less accuracy of the copyist, or his greater
or less taste for discourses of edification.</p>

<p>Nor is the <i>Queste</i> by the same hand as was responsible
for the final moulding of the <i>Lancelot</i> story; though so
closely connected with, indeed dependent upon, that story,
it yet in many points stands in flagrant contradiction with
it, and there is little doubt that the <i>Lancelot</i> would gain
greatly in coherence if the <i>Queste</i> were omitted, and the
passages preparatory to it eliminated from the original
romance. These remarks apply also to the <i>Grand S.
Graal</i> in its present form, though, as we shall see, this
last named romance does not stand on precisely the
same footing as the <i>Queste</i> with which it is now closely
connected.</p>

<p>The following facts seem to stand out clearly. Both
these Grail romances, the <i>Queste</i> especially, depend <i>entirely</i>
for their interest on Lancelot. They are the glorification
of his race as that from which the Grail Winner is predestined
to spring. The genealogies, however they may
vary (as they do in the different versions), are all devoted
to this object. They are most closely connected with, and
practically presuppose each other; yet admitting, as I think
we must admit, that they do not represent the original
form of the Grail story, they do not produce the impression
of romances which have been worked over with the view of
substituting a new hero for the one in whose honour the
tale was originally constructed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in the case of the <i>Grand S. Graal</i> we must,
I think, admit imitation; even as in the original Borron
cycle the <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i> was designed as an introduction
to the life and deeds of the Grail Winner, Perceval,
so in this, the latest form of the cycle, the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to the <i>Queste</i> is built upon and expanded from the
<i>Joseph</i>. The introduction is based upon and follows
the lines of the old introduction, but the <i>Queste</i> is a new
<i>Queste</i>.</p>

<p>Let us be quite clear on this point. Galahad may have
in a measure supplanted Perceval, but he has neither
dispossessed nor robbed him. He has taken over no one of
his characteristics, no one of his feats. Such traces of the
Perceval story as remain are found in connection with
Perceval himself; he, too, achieves the Grail <i>Queste</i>. He
has undergone a change, and a change for the worse, but
that was quite as much due to the evolution of the Grail
as a Christian talisman as to the invention of Galahad.
The hero of the Didot <i>Perceval</i> and <i>Perceval li Gallois</i> is
as inferior to the hero of Chrétien and Wolfram as is the
Perceval of the Galahad <i>Queste</i>. The truth is that Perceval
is still the Grail hero, but he shares that character with
another whose invention is due to special and easily discernible
causes.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The point of view of the writer of the <i>Queste</i> is not that
of the compilers of the <i>Lancelot</i>. As I remarked in the
previous chapter, the view taken by the <i>Lancelot</i> of the
relations between the hero and the queen is frankly
unmoral. Neither is blamed for his or her action, neither
is apparently conscious of wrong-doing. In the <i>Queste</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Lancelot's conscience is sorely vexed, and his sin insisted
upon. The compilers of the <i>Lancelot</i> have a very courtly
respect for women&mdash;the author of the <i>Queste</i> despises them
utterly. The interest of the <i>Lancelot</i> lies in the relation
between the sexes&mdash;the respective duties of knight and
lady&mdash;the theme which inspires the <i>Queste</i> is their abiding
separation.</p>

<p>Again, compare the treatment of the various characters
of the story in the two respective sections. Next to
Galahad and Perceval, the hero of the <i>Queste</i> is Bohort
(Bors). But for a single youthful lapse he yields in
nothing to those doughty champions of celibacy: his purity,
alike of body and soul, is emphatically insisted upon; his
confession fills the priest who receives it with a fervour of
admiration; yet it is precisely this saintly youth who, in the
section preceding and following the <i>Queste</i> (the <i>Lancelot</i>
and the <i>Mort Artur</i>), is the confidant and go-between of
Lancelot and Guinevere. It is Bohort who seeks Lancelot
at the secret bidding of the queen, Bohort who carries
love-tokens between them, who arranges meetings. It is
he and Lionel who consult the queen as to the delicate
question of Lancelot's future relations with the lady who
has cured him from the illness caused by drinking the
poisoned spring; he who is the confidant of Guinevere's
indignation at the supposed love-affair between Lancelot
and the maiden of Escarloet; and if he tries to prevent
the last fatal meeting between them it is with no view of
hindering a wrong to his lord Arthur, but solely because he
has reason to suspect the trap laid for the lovers. The
two presentments not simply fail to agree, but stand in flat
contradiction with each other.</p>

<p>Lionel, again, is throughout the <i>Lancelot</i> a valiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
knight, warmly attached alike to his brother and to his
cousin. Like Bohort he takes Lancelot's part on every
occasion, with him he quits the court when the queen, in
an access of jealousy, banishes Lancelot. When he is
finally slain both Bohort and Lancelot are overcome with
grief. But the <i>Queste</i> paints him in the most repulsive
colours: violent, brutal, and unreasoning to a degree. He
is so indignant with his brother for going to the rescue of
a maiden rather than of himself (when both are equally in
danger) that he does his best to kill him in revenge. He
does kill an unoffending hermit, and a fellow knight of
the Round Table who would intervene, and finally it
needs a special interposition of Providence to part the two
brothers before a fatal issue to the conflict forced on by
Lionel has taken place.</p>

<p>Hector, Lancelot's half-brother, who in the later <i>Lancelot</i>
story is one of the bravest and most distinguished knights
of the court, is in the <i>Queste</i> held up to scorn and rebuke;
while the author of this romance has no colours too black
in which to paint the character of Gawain, who, though
deposed from his position of chief hero, is, throughout the
<i>Lancelot</i> proper, treated with the greatest respect. He is
entirely loved and trusted by king and queen, and if his
valour is in the long-run surpassed by that of Lancelot,
the compiler is careful to preserve his honour intact by
pointing out, first, that he never recovered from the severe
wounds received in the war with Galehault, second, that
he was over twenty years Lancelot's senior. The final
conflict between them, the most deadly in which Lancelot
was ever engaged, was fought when Gawain was seventy-two
and Arthur ninety-two years of age; further, as we shall
see presently, in some versions the conclusion is more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the character of a drawn battle than of a defeat for
Gawain.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>It is, I think, quite clear that the Galahad-Grail romances
are the work of another hand than that responsible for the
main body of the <i>Lancelot</i> cycle; and the work of one
who was at small pains to harmonise his story with the
branches already existing. It is indeed doubtful whether
the writer had any thorough acquaintance with the legend
as a whole. It is noteworthy that the points of contact
with what we may perhaps call the 'secular' section are all
restricted to the <i>later</i> part of the story, that commencing
with what M. Paulin Paris called the <i>Agravain</i> section.
Between the <i>Grand S. Graal</i>, the Galahad <i>Queste</i>, and
the later part of the <i>Lancelot</i> there are a number of what
we may call cross-references, the precise value of which
will be very difficult to determine. But they do not stray
outside a certain limit&mdash;they are restricted to Lancelot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the Knight of the Round Table, the queen's lover, and
father of the Grail Winner&mdash;they do not appear to know
Lancelot the <i>protégé</i> of the Lady of the Lake. In this
character the Grail romances ignore him, nor do they
appear to know anything of his most famous adventure,
the freeing of Guinevere from Meleagant.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>It is the later and not the earlier <i>Lancelot</i> story which
is known to the writer of the <i>Queste</i>; and the more we
study the romance the plainer this becomes. The <i>Lancelot</i>
romance may really be divided into two great divisions,
the <i>Enfances</i>, <i>Charrette</i>, and <i>Galehault</i> section, which is
practically unaffected by the <i>Grail</i> tradition, though it
shows evident signs of contact with the <i>Perceval</i> story;
and the latter portion which (saving the <i>Mort Artur</i>,
unaffected except by the addition of the concluding <i>Queste</i>
paragraph, easily removed) has been redacted under the
influence of the Galahad-Grail accretion.</p>

<p>Till the versions concerned have been critically examined
we cannot determine the value or gauge the
evidence of the matter common to the <i>Lancelot</i>, <i>Grand S.
Graal</i>, and <i>Queste</i>. The most noticeable instances are the
following: the keeping of the Grail at Castle Corbenic, the
founding of which is related in the <i>Grand S. Graal</i>; the
characters of King Pelles and his father, with regard to
whom the evidence varies,&mdash;as a rule, the character of the
Fisher King appears to be confined to the former, that of
the Maimed King to the latter (the author of the <i>Queste</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
appears to have no idea that the two characters are one
and the same);&mdash;the daughter of King Pelles, and his son
Eliezer. This latter is, I think, peculiar to the Lancelot-Galahad
story, the Perceval versions do not know him.
The adventure of the broken sword borne by Eliezer, told
both in <i>Lancelot</i> and <i>Grand S. Graal</i>, and achieved,
though without satisfactory explanation, in <i>Queste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The
Boiling Fountain and Bleeding Tomb adventures, also
told in the two first, partly achieved in the <i>Lancelot</i>,
and achievement summarily announced in <i>Queste</i>. The
Perilous Cemetery, origin stated in <i>Grand S. Graal</i>, vainly
attempted by Gawain and Hector in <i>Lancelot</i>, final achievement
barely recorded in <i>Queste</i>.</p>

<p>In these last instances the story may well have been in
the <i>Lancelot</i>, and taken over by the compiler of <i>Grand S.
Graal</i>; the <i>Queste</i> makes very little of them; they only
serve to keep up the connection between the 'secular' and
'religious' sections.</p>

<p>With regard to the Corbenic-Grail adventures, I am
inclined, as I said before, to look upon them as due to
the influence of the Gawain story, and as already existing,
in a purely adventurous form, in the <i>Lancelot</i>, before it was
formally united to the Grail Quest.</p>

<p>On the whole, I decidedly lean to the opinion that
<i>Grand S. Graal</i> and <i>Queste</i> are by one and the same hand&mdash;the
one based upon and expanded from an older poem,
the other a practically new invention, the two being designed
to replace the <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i> and <i>Perceval</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of the earlier Grail cycle. As I said above, the author
was very little concerned about the harmony of his work.
So long as by a superficial rearrangement and interpolation
of incidental adventures he could produce an appearance
of harmony, he cared nothing at all about the more important
questions of continuity of treatment, and preservation
of tone and character. The result is that his work, which
stands practically as he left it, is in flagrant contradiction
with the story it is designed to complete.</p>

<p>But what was the motive which led to the setting aside
of the earlier Perceval <i>Queste</i>, and what the causes which
determined the particular form assumed by its successor?</p>

<p>I do not think they are difficult to detect.</p>

<p>During the later years of the twelfth and earlier years
of the thirteenth century we see two stories in process of
gradual evolution&mdash;the Perceval-Grail story and the Lancelot
legend. One early took a decidedly mystical and
ecclesiastical bent, the other became more and more
worldly and secular. The two appear to have had an
equal hold on popular imagination, they early came into
touch with each other, but they never really blended.
The <i>Lancelot</i>, as the younger, borrowed at the outset
certain features from the <i>Perceval</i>, but it retained its
own distinctive character; while the elder story slowly
changed, the Grail, at first a subordinate element in the
story, gradually but surely dominating the tale, which
became more and more ecclesiastical, while the hero
became more and more conventional.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>But at a certain point it became evident that these lines
of tradition could no longer remain parallel, they must
coalesce, or the one must yield to the other. The Grail
quest had become the most popular adventure of Arthur's
court, one after another the knights were being drawn into
the mystic circle; how could the most popular and most
valiant of the knights of the Round Table, for this Lancelot
had now become, remain outside the chosen group? It
was plain that Lancelot must take part in the Grail quest;
it was equally plain that the first knight of the court could
not be allowed to come out of the ordeal with any detriment
to his prestige; yet the Grail demanded purity of
life, and Lancelot was the queen's lover. More, the
queen's lover he must remain or forfeit his hold on popular
sympathy.</p>

<p>How was it possible to preserve intact at once Lancelot's
superiority and the purity of the Christian talisman? Only
in one way: by giving him a son who should achieve the
quest and then vanish, leaving Lancelot still <i>facile princeps</i>
among the knights of the Round Table, with the added
glory of having been the father of the Grail Winner.</p>

<p>But this son could not be the child of Guinevere. The
offspring of a guilty <i>liaison</i> could not be the winner of the
sacrosanct talisman; yet Lancelot must be faithful to his
queen&mdash;how solve this problem? The story in its primitive
form gave the hint for the required development. Who
more fitted to become the mother of the Grail Winner than
the fair maiden who filled the office of Grail-bearer?<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
The obvious propriety of such a relationship was bound
sooner or later to strike the imagination of some redactor.
The Arthurian story already possessed the machinery by
which Lancelot could become father of the elect child,
while remaining Guinevere's lover; Brisane had but to do
for Elaine what Merlin did for Uther, and the difficulty
was overcome. Moreover, <i>Helaine</i> was, in the old story,
the name of the Grail Winner's father, nothing more easy
than to bestow the same name on the new hero's mother.
All this was only a question of clever adjustment of already
existing factors.</p>

<p>Perceval, of course, was in possession, but the later
development of his story, which had converted him from
a genuine, faulty, but loving and lovable human being,
true man and faithful husband, into an aggressively proselytising
and persecuting celibate, had made it possible for
him still to retain a place in the romance; he could act
as second to Galahad, and, like him, disappear, the quest
once achieved. But having thus disposed in Lancelot's
interest of the two who might have seriously challenged
his fame as a knight, Perceval, the real, Galahad, the vicarious
(for I think we can only regard him as his father's representative),
achiever of the quest, it became necessary to
add a third, who should bring back to court the tidings
of their success. It is quite obvious, from the point of
view of the <i>Lancelot</i> story, that Perceval and Galahad <i>could
not</i> be permitted to return. The third was easily found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in the person of Lancelot's nearest relative, the knight who,
his shield unstained by the bar-sinister which marked that
of Hector, had been gradually rising in popular favour;
Bohort owes his position in the <i>Queste</i> to his position in
the <i>Lancelot</i> proper.</p>

<p>The evolution of this character has not, I believe,
attracted much attention hitherto, but it is one of the
most remarkable features of the <i>Lancelot</i> story. In the
earliest versions, represented by the <i>Lanzelet</i>, etc., he is not
known at all.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> When he first appears he plays but a small
part, gradually his rôle becomes more and more prominent,
till in the later portion of the prose <i>Lancelot</i> he has become
a very efficient understudy to the hero, even surpassing in
valour Gawain himself. Thus, on the return of the knights
from one of their numerous quests in search of Lancelot,
when they are called upon to rehearse their adventures, in
order that a record of them may be made, it is decided
that their rank, in order of merit, is Bohort, Gawain, Hector,
Gaheriet, Lionel, and Baudemagus. Gawain and his brother,
the representatives of the older stratum of Arthurian
tradition, are the only two who can compete with the
all-conquering race of Ban, and the bosom friend of that
race, Baudemagus.</p>

<p>Finally he is represented as the father of a son who bids
fair to rival his ancestors in valour. When a critical study
of the Lancelot <span class="smcap">mss.</span> is seriously undertaken, I think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
shall find that the position occupied by Bohort in the
story will afford a valuable indication of the relative age of
the redaction.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to find that among the objections
which will doubtless be advanced against the theory here
advocated one will be that it is too complete in detail, too
'cut and dried,' if I may use the term, to be free from suspicion.
To this I would answer that I believe in examining
the later stages of Arthurian romance we must follow a somewhat
different process from that which we employ for the
earlier. The Arthurian poems, being in a large measure independent,
and never having formed part of a 'cyclic' whole,
may well be studied separately, in, and for, themselves, though
of course we would not leave out of sight variants of the
same story. But the later prose romances, those which
have avowedly formed parts of a cycle, must be studied,
not separately, but in conjunction with the other romances
with which they were connected. They are in the position
of the parts of a dissected puzzle, the study of one part by
itself will never really help us to understand the whole, it
is only by studying collective sections, and trying continually
new combinations, that we can hope to find the original
disposition of the parts.</p>

<p>It is no use to study the <i>Queste</i> romance by itself. If we
wish to know how it stands with regard to the <i>Lancelot</i>, we
must study it <i>with</i> the <i>Lancelot</i>, and if we do this certain
points become absolutely clear. The <i>Queste</i> pre-supposes
a very advanced stage of the <i>Lancelot</i> story; one at which
the family of the hero, quite as much as the hero himself,
is the subject of glorification.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>The Galahad <i>Queste</i> is absolutely unthinkable without a
previous knowledge of the <i>Lancelot</i> romances; as a matter
of fact, it stands in closer relation to these than it does to
any earlier Grail quest. The <i>Lancelot</i> romances, on the
contrary, would be quite complete and far more coherent
without the <i>Queste</i>. I have commented already on the
striking discrepancies between the sections, but I have not
so far dwelt at any length on the extraordinary lack of
Grail references in the <i>Mort Artur</i>, the section immediately
following the <i>Queste</i>. If we set on one side the introductory
passage, which I have no shadow of doubt does not
belong to the <i>Mort Artur</i> at all, but is the concluding
passage of the <i>Queste</i>, there is no evidence of the influence
of the latter throughout the whole of this last section of the
cycle. Galahad is never mentioned; he was&mdash;and is not&mdash;as
completely as if he had never been. Lancelot never
thinks of, never refers to, his valiant son; his whole thought
and care is for the queen, whom we were previously told
he had renounced. I do not think it possible for any one to
read the <i>Mort Artur</i> and believe that the <i>Queste</i> forms an
integral part of the <i>Lancelot</i> story. On the other hand, cut
out the <i>Queste</i>, suppress the few passages in the immediately
preceding section of the <i>Lancelot</i> story which relate to it,
and you have a tale as complete and coherent as is possible
for any legend which has been the fruit of long growth and
evolution, and has not possessed from the outset a clear
and definite purpose and outline.</p>

<p>Admit, as I think we must needs admit, that the <i>Lancelot</i>
and the <i>Grail</i> stories form two independent streams of
tradition; recognise, as we must recognise, their diverse
character,&mdash;one strongly secular, the other strongly ecclesiastical,&mdash;and
I think we must own that if in their completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
form they were to coalesce, that coalition could only be
carried out under the conditions suggested above, which
conditions we find fulfilled in the Galahad <i>Queste</i>. For me
this romance is the last word of the <i>Lancelot</i> evolution, the
final blending of two separate and important streams of
tradition, the <i>grant conte</i> of Lancelot and the <i>grant conte</i>
of Perceval and the Grail, the which is <i>chiés et fin de tous les
contes</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">THE DUTCH LANCELOT</p>


<p>In the previous chapters we have examined, so far as the
material at our disposal permitted, the <i>Lancelot</i> legend in
its gradual evolution from a collection of scattered tales, or
<i>lais</i>, to the vast body of cyclic romance which was its final
form. In this task we have restricted ourselves to those
features which more intimately concern the personal character
and fortunes of our hero; a choice which leaves
untouched a large section of his adventures, such as his
friendship with Galehault, and his winning of the <i>Dolorous
Garde</i>. These are features which, affecting no romance or
chronicle outside the <i>Lancelot</i> proper, cannot well be examined
till more versions of this latter are available. In
this, the concluding section of these studies, I propose,
leaving the question of the nature and origin of the legend,
to discuss the relation subsisting between those different
versions of the text, on an examination of which I have
based the three preceding chapters dealing with the prose
<i>Lancelot</i>.</p>

<p>The texts in question are (1) the so-called Dutch <i>Lancelot</i>;
(2) the printed edition of 1533 (Lenoire, Paris); (3) Dr.
Sommer's summary of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, based upon the
printed edition of 1513, and compared by him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Malory's text; (4) Dr. Furnivall's edition of the <i>Queste</i>;
and (5) Malory's <i>Morte Arthur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> This gives us practically
four different texts for each section (Dr. Sommer having
also used the <i>Queste</i>), two of which, the Dutch <i>Lancelot</i>
and the 1533 edition, appear to me to be of far greater
importance than has hitherto been suspected.</p>

<p>I propose to publish in an Appendix a detailed summary
of the contents of the distinctively <i>Lancelot</i> portion of the
<b>D. L.</b>, but the compilation covers such an extent of ground,
and contains texts of such value to the student of Arthurian
literature, that I think it will not be superfluous to give here
a brief outline of its general character.</p>

<p>A noticeable peculiarity of the version is, that, contrary
to all other known versions of the <i>Lancelot-Galahad-Grail</i>
story, it is in verse and not in prose. The <span class="smcap">ms.</span> containing it
appears to be of the beginning of the fourteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
but Dr. Jonckbloet gives reason to think that the version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
contained in it was decidedly older than this date, and
there are certainly references to the <i>Lancelot</i> story in much
earlier Dutch <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> Probably it is a compilation similar to
that of Sir Thomas Malory, intended to combine the
various romances of the Arthurian cycle with which the
compiler was familiar, or of which <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> were at his disposal.
In the first instance it was a translation, and I think we
must hold a very faithful translation, from the French.
Even as we have it we shall find that it agrees closely with
parallel French versions. In its original form it consisted
of four books, the first of which has unfortunately been lost.</p>

<p>Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> begins with what M. Paulin Paris called the
<i>Agravain</i> section of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Enfances</i>,
<i>Galehault</i>, and <i>Charrette</i> portions are not included.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The
first 36,000 lines follow the course of the <i>Lancelot</i>; at line
36,947 it takes up the <i>Perceval</i> at the point of the arrival of the
Grail messenger, and for about two thousand lines goes on to
give an account of the achieving of the adventures mentioned
by her. In some points the compiler agrees closely with
Chrétien and seems to have followed his version, in others
he departs entirely from any known version of the <i>Perceval</i>.
Sometimes his names agree rather with Wolfram than with
Chrétien; <i>e.g.</i> the lady is Orgeloise simply, not L'Orguelleuse
de Logres; and Gawain's challenger is Ginganbrisil, a form
which Professor Yorke Powell pointed out some years ago
as the probable source of Wolfram's Kingrimursel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>L. 41,420, we have a visit of Gawain to the Grail castle,
agreeing closely with that found in the Montpelier <i>Perceval</i>,
and also, Dr. Jonckbloet informs us, with that contained in
a German version of the <i>Perceval</i> preserved at Rome (cf.
Jonckbloet, vol. i. p. xxiv.), adventures of Gariette and
Griflette, and the fight between Gawain and Ginganbrisil,
which ends in the victory of the former, and the king of
Scavalon becoming Arthur's 'man.' This again is not recounted
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Ll. 42,540-47,262 contain the romance of <i>Morien</i>, son
of Agloval, the hero of which bears a curious resemblance
to Wolfram's Feirefis. In this romance occurs the episode
of Lancelot's conflict with a monster, which I have examined
in chap. iii. This concludes Book <span class="smcap">II.</span></p>

<p>Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> opens with the <i>Queste</i>, the text of which I
shall examine in detail further on; it extends to over
11,000 ll. The remainder of the book is occupied by a
group of important episodic romances, some of which are
found nowhere else. They are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>11,161. <i>La vengeance de Raguidel.</i><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>14,300. An adventure of Lancelot, Bohort, and Dodinel,
when the latter rescues a maiden tied up in a tree.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>14,681. <i>Le Chevalier à la Manche</i> (van den riddere
metter mouwen).</p>

<p>18,603. <i>Gauvain et Kei</i> (Hoe Keye Waleweine verriet).</p>

<p>22,271. <i>Lancelot et le cerf au pied blanc</i> (van der jonc
frouwen metten hondekine).</p>

<p>23,122-26,980. <i>Torec.</i><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> <i>Mort Artur</i>, 13,054 ll. The united three
books thus comprising a total of over 87,000 lines.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above brief summary that the
<b>D. L.</b> presents many features of great interest for the
student of the Arthurian story, but so far, with the exception
of the studies published by M. Gaston Paris, to
which I have just referred, it does not appear to have
attracted much attention from scholars. It is especially to
be regretted that Dr. Sommer did not use it for the purpose
of his 'Malory' collation; had he done so, he would
certainly have come, on many points, to a very different
conclusion from that at which he ultimately arrived.</p>

<p>In the following comparison I shall confine my remarks
chiefly to such decided variants as cannot possibly be
ascribed to the mistakes or emendations of copyists; nor
shall I include those minor verbal differences which, however
important for a critical edition of the text, do not in
themselves definitely prove a divergence of sources. The
point I desire to prove is that the versions <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b> represent a text radically different from that consulted
by Dr. Sommer; and that, in conjunction with
Malory, they may be held to represent a family of <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
hitherto unregarded, or unsuspected.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>As readers of Malory are aware, he gives no account
of the birth or early adventures of Lancelot; the section
dealing with that hero begins with Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and takes up
his adventures at a point well advanced in what, following
M. Paulin Paris, I have called the <i>Agravain</i> section (l. 13,351
in <b>D. L.</b>). That Malory had before him any version of
the earlier section of the <i>Lancelot</i> I very much doubt. It
must be apparent to any careful reader that, in his view,
the Lady of the Lake is connected rather with Arthur than
with Lancelot; whenever she intervenes in the story it is to
aid the former, rather than the latter. I incline to the
belief that Malory's <span class="smcap">ms.</span> only began at an advanced point
of the story, and that he knew little, or nothing, of what
had preceded it.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the Terriquen (<b>D. L.</b> gives
the name as Tarquijn) adventure, <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b>, and <b>M.</b>
all represent Lancelot and Lionel as sleeping under the
shadow of a '<i>pomier</i>' instead of a <i>perron</i> as in <b>S.</b><a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>When Hector comes to the fountain he finds <b>D. L.</b> <span class="smcap">LX.</span>
shields and helmets, and <span class="smcap">XL.</span> swords (the first letters have
evidently been transposed and should read <span class="smcap">XL.</span>). <b>1533.</b>
Forty-five helmets, forty-five swords, and 'more than' forty-five
shields. <b>S.</b> Forty swords, forty-five shields, and five
spears: helmets are not mentioned. Here <b>S.</b> appears to
have a confused version of the two preceding accounts.</p>

<p>In the account of the queens who carry off Lancelot
<b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree with <b>S.</b> in naming the ladies (the
queen in <b>D. L.</b> is of Foreestan, <i>not</i> Sorestan); otherwise
the accounts seem to vary. <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> do
not say, as does <b>S.</b>, that the first-named is on her way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to Norgales through 'Sorelois,' but that her land 'borders
on' these kingdoms. It is not the <i>three</i> but only the
two last-named, Morgain le Fay and Sibile (Cybele)
l'enchanteresse, who are learned in enchantments; and
neither <b>D. L.</b> nor <b>1533</b> give any indication of their
being the 'queen's ladies' as <b>S.</b> represents; they are
simply travelling with her.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The lands of the heiress of Rochedon were not seized
by the <i>King</i> of Sorestan, as <b>S.</b> states, but by the <i>queen</i> who
had been left her guardian (<b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>). This is
much more in accordance with the rest of the story.
Otherwise these three versions agree against <b>M.</b></p>

<p>Later on both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree in speaking of
Galehodyn as the <i>neveu</i>, not the <i>filz</i> of Gallehault, as in <b>S.</b>
They are of course right.</p>

<p>In the account of the tournament there are a number of
small variants. Judging from <b>S.</b>, who gives a very condensed
summary, <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> are again more correct
in details.</p>

<p>On p. 186 of <b>S.</b> the summary departs widely from <b>D. L.</b>
and <b>1533</b>. Thus, according to <b>S.</b>, Lancelot, seeking
for Hector and Lionel, has met with Bohort, Yvain, and
four other knights at the 'Chastel du Trespas.' Lancelot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
proposes that each of the <i>six</i> knights (<i>sic</i>) (there were of
course seven) shall each ride forth separately and return to
the castle 'a la feste de toussainz.' In <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>
Lancelot has started <i>accompanied</i> by Bohort, Baudemagus,
and Gaheret. <i>En route</i> they meet Mordred, naked, and
being thrashed with thorns by 'Math&oelig;us die felle'
(Marchant li felon), rescue him, and ride to Chastel du
Trespas, where Yvain is imprisoned, whom they also free.
It is Yvain, not Lancelot, who suggests the separation
and quest.</p>

<p>Again, in the fight between Lancelot and 'Terriquen,'
both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree against <b>S.</b> and <b>M.</b> in failing to
mention Gaheret's (they have the correct spelling) horse,
and saying that Lancelot rides off on his own. Whereas,
later on, <b>S.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree in giving 'three varlets and
three sommiers' and <b>D. L.</b> and <b>M.</b> agree in a 'foster'
with four horses.</p>

<p>In the question of the final disposal of the castle <b>D. L.</b>
and <b>1533</b> again fall into line against <b>S.</b> The latter says
that the knights exchange Terriquen's castle for horses,
though not very good ones. I suspect this of being a hasty
summary which does not represent the text; <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b> are so much more detailed. <b>D. L.</b> says that 'Die
grave van den <i>Pale</i> (later on <i>Parke</i>, which is I think the
correct reading) is rejoiced at the event as his '<i>neve</i>' was
one of the prisoners. He gives all Arthur's knights very
good horses. That he receives the castle is not told,
though he afterwards appears as the owner. <b>1533</b> says
that 'Keux<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> du Parc' has a 'brother' prisoner: delighted
at his safety he gives them all horses, very good to Arthur's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
knights, not so good to the others. Out of gratitude they
offer him the castle. If <b>S.</b> correctly represents the text
of 1513, it is clear, I think, that <b>1533</b> gives the original
reading, which has been condensed, but rightly understood,
by <b>D. L.</b>, and confused in <b>S.</b></p>

<p>In the account of the adventures at the castle <b>D. L.</b>,
agreeing in the main with <b>S.</b> and <b>1533</b>, as against <b>M.</b>,
yet in one point falls into line with this latter against the
other two. Both <b>S.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree in saying that
Lancelot ties his horse to a <i>tree</i>, <b>M.</b> says 'to a ringe on
the walle'; in <b>D. L.</b> he ties his horse, when he comes to
the '<i>meester torre, vor die porte al te hant</i>,' which seems to
imply <b>M.</b>'s 'ringe.'<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>I now come to a most extraordinary oversight on the
part of Dr. Sommer. On p. 191 and again on p. 274 of
his <i>Sources of Malory</i> he commits himself to the statement
that <b>M.</b> is the only known source for certain adventures
of Lancelot, his rescue of Kay, his riding off in Kay's
armour, etc., and proceeds from this supposed peculiarity
to postulate a lost '<i>Suite de Lancelot</i>,' of which this is a
precious fragment. Now, not only are these adventures
recorded both in <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>, but they are found
in the summary given by M. Paulin Paris on p. 323 of
vol. v. of the <i>Romans de la Table Ronde</i>.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>The adventure with Kay does not, in the original,
occur at this point, but follows after Lancelot's long imprisonment
by Morgain; his freeing Lionel from the dungeon
of the King of Estrangeloet; winning the hill guarded by
Bohort; and discovering the tomb of his grandfather;&mdash;a
sequence of incident in which <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree
perfectly.</p>

<p>Of the following adventures contained in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> <b>S.</b>
consequently gives no summary. Throughout <b>M.</b> very
closely agrees with <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>, but he omits to state,
as do both these versions, that Lancelot's arraying himself
in Kay's armour was due to the dim light of early morning.
He believed himself to be donning his own, and was unaware
of the error till his host detected it, when he refused to
change, foreseeing the amusing complications which would
result. This, having no bearing on the story, which is
concerned with the <i>fact</i>, not with the motive, was probably
omitted by <b>M.</b> Another slight variation in <b>M.</b>'s version
is that he gives three knights and three pavilions, whereas
the other two agree in giving two knights and four pavilions.
Nor are the knights named as in <b>M.</b>, but this is most
probably due to the English writer, who hardly ever fails
to name his characters.</p>

<p>The four knights of the Round Table are the same in
all three cases, and <b>M.</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree in the order,
while <b>1533</b> makes Yvain the last to joust. The two
first are probably correct, as Gawain, being the most
noted of the four, would probably be the last to try his
fate. Both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree in a feature omitted
by <b>M.</b>, that Mordred was originally in the company of
these four, but being severely wounded on a previous
occasion cannot joust (<b>D. L.</b>); has been left at a castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
that morning (<b>1533</b>). <b>M.</b> also omits to say that Segramore
reveals their names to Lancelot, who, overcome with grief
at having so ill-treated his friends, throws away his shield,
and rides off weeping. This causes the four knights to
suspect his identity, and they take the shield and carry
it with them to court. I suspect that this was in <b>M.</b>'s
original, as he makes Gawain say 'whan we come to the
courte than &#383;hal we wete,' which is the reason they give
in the other versions for taking the shield; accordingly,
they hang it on a pillar in the middle of the hall until it is
recognised.</p>

<p>Immediately after this adventure <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>
record one of which <b>M.</b> gives no hint, but which is important
in view of a remark made by Dr. Sommer on p. 204
of his study. Lancelot, having overthrown these four
knights, comes to two pavilions, in one of which is the lady
who cured him from his illness at the Poisoned Spring;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
as they talk a party of knights and ladies ride up, with
them a fair child three years old (<b>D. L.</b>); two years old
(<b>1533</b>). This is Bohort's son, Hélie le Blank, whom Lancelot
is delighted to see. Now, Dr. Sommer tells us that,
saving in the record of this infant's birth, the allusion to it
in the <i>Queste</i>, and the mention of Hélie being at Arthur's
court when Lancelot, Hector, and Perceval return from
l'Île de Joie, there is no mention of him in the prose
<i>Lancelot</i>. It seems clear that a large section of the
<i>Agravain</i> must have been omitted in the versions consulted
by Dr. Sommer.</p>

<p>Of the three subsequent adventures in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, the final
one, that of the knight who smites off his lady's head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
is compelled by Lancelot to do penance for his crime by
carrying the dead body from one court to another, is also
in our two versions, but occurs at an earlier point in the
story. In both he is to go first to Arthur's court, then to
that of Baudemagus, and lastly to the King of Norgales. If
all spare his life he may live. <b>M.</b> departs from this by
only directing him in the first instance to go to Arthur's
court: it is Guinevere who sends him on to the Pope. The
variant is probably Malory's own.</p>

<p>The other two adventures are not in either <b>D. L.</b> or
<b>1533</b>. The Perilous Chapel, I suspect, was taken over
from a Perceval section. Meliot de Logres, and the fetching
of a piece of cloth from the chapel of a 'Perilous
Cemetery' are both in <i>Perceval li Gallois</i> though not connected
with each other. It is noticeable that <b>M.</b> never
refers to the 'Perilous Cemetery' of the <i>Lancelot</i> proper,
that of the upright swords, but drops out the reference to
Galahad's achieving of it, which must certainly have been
in his copy of the <i>Queste</i>. I think there may have been
two Perilous Cemeteries, one of the Borron <i>Lancelot-Perceval</i>,
the other of the Map <i>Lancelot-Galahad</i> cycles,
and that this is the first and older.</p>

<p>The adventure of the Lady and the Hawk in chap. xvi.
I have not been able to trace.</p>

<p>The events of <b>M.</b>, Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, are not recorded in either
<b>D. L.</b> or <b>1533</b>, with this possible exception, that when
the knights return to court after the adventures recorded
above, and are called upon for an account of their doings,
Gawain relates how he fought with Gariette, <i>not knowing
that he was his brother</i>; which looks as if the story (not
related in detail) might represent a version of the similar
encounter in Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> It seems clear that, full as is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
account given in both these versions, the compilers still
knew a great deal more than they included.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Books <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, <span class="smcap">IX.</span>, and <span class="smcap">X.</span> of <b>M.</b> follow the prose <i>Tristan</i>,
and not till Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span> do we return to the <i>Lancelot</i>. This
book opens with the adventures at Corbenic (<b>D. L.</b>,
Cambenoyc, Cambenoyt, or Cabenoyt). <b>D. L.</b> fails to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
mention that the lady of the bath is naked, and consistently
calls the serpent of the tomb a serpent, never a dragon,
in this differing from the other versions. <b>1533</b>, at this
point, after relating the achievement of their adventures,
has a curious remark: '<i>Ainsi prend fin le premier volume
des vertus et glorieulx fais et gestes du noble et puissant
chevalier Lancelot du Lac et des compaignons de la Table
Ronde</i>,' and then continues, without any break of chapter,
to relate the succeeding adventure with the Grail and King
Pelles' daughter. So far from this passage occurring at
the end of vol. i., the <i>Agravain</i> section does not begin till
fol. xxxix. of the second volume of this edition. It is
possible that when a critical edition of the <i>Lancelot</i> is
prepared the above remark may be a guide to an earlier
redaction, in which Lancelot was not the father of the
Grail Winner. <b>D. L.</b> has nothing corresponding to
this.</p>

<p>In the account given by <b>D. L.</b> of Bohort's visit to
Corbenic, the fight with the knight who keeps the bridge
for love of Elaine is omitted, but it was evidently in the
source, as later on the knight arrives at court as vanquished,
and his name is then given as <i>Brimol van Pleiche</i>, thus
agreeing with <b>M.</b>, <i>Bromel la Pleche</i>, against the <i>Brunet
du Plaissis</i> or <i>Plessis</i> of <b>1533</b> and <b>S.</b> <b>1533</b> records the
combat.</p>

<p>On page 195 of the <i>Studies</i> we read that Dr. Sommer's
source contained no passage to the effect of <b>M.</b>, p. 576,
30-32: 'Mervelle not said sir bors / for this half yere he
(Lancelot) hath ben in pryson with Morgan le fay, kyng
Arthurs syster /.' But <b>1533</b> gives it: 'il a este en la
prison ou il y a une dame plus dung an entier,' which
is nearer the real duration of Lancelot's imprisonment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
This seems to indicate that <b>M.</b> had a fairly full Ms.
source, from which he selected at pleasure.</p>

<p>Dr. Sommer gives no summary of Bohort's Grail adventures,
so I cannot tell if there be any interesting
variants between the French versions, but both <b>1533</b>
and <b>D. L.</b> contain two features, not reproduced in <b>M.</b>,
which seem to indicate a knowledge of an older Grail
tradition. In both the old man tells Bohort that he has
seen '<i>la lance Vengeresse</i>' the '<i>wrake spere</i>,' he who sits in
the Siege Perilous shall know the truth of adventure.'<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
(This, of course, might be Perceval equally as well as
Galahad.) Galahad and Lancelot are not mentioned
throughout.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The Maimed King and the Fisher King are
one and the same person. All these points confirm my
suspicion that the Corbenic adventure was originally taken
over from an earlier, probably a Gawain, <i>Queste</i>.</p>

<p>In the events relating Elayne's visit to the court and
Lancelot's madness, <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> in the main agree
with <b>S.</b>, but with small variants. In both Elayne leaves
the court of her own free will, but Arthur does not escort
her; she speaks to Bohort before leaving. The knight
encountered by Bohort is alone in <b>D. L.</b>, thus agreeing
with <b>M.</b>; while in <b>1533</b> he does not meet him till after
he has rejoined Lionel and Hector. The knights who go in
search of Lancelot are in <b>D. L.</b> thirty-two in number, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
as later on we are told that twenty-five have returned, this
does not seem to be a mistake for twenty-three, as we might
otherwise think. <b>1533</b> does not give the original number
as thirty-two, but agrees with <b>D. L.</b> as to those who return,
which confirms this supposition.</p>

<p>In all that relates to Perceval and his first appearance
at court, <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree on the whole with <b>S.</b>
rather than with <b>M.</b>, but neither of them give any names of
Perceval's brothers (save Agloval, who fetches him from
his home), nor say how many there were. Lamorak is
never mentioned (I believe this character belongs to quite
a late redaction). In this and in the reference to Gawain's
having slain Perceval's father, I think we have the influence
of the <i>Tristan</i>.</p>

<p>In the account of Perceval's being driven from court by
the mockery of Kay and Mordred, <b>D. L.</b> has a remark
which again shows the influence of an earlier tradition:
Perceval is described as '<i>Eene harde jonge creature, ende
die wel simpel sceen te dien</i>.' Nowhere else is there any
sign of the simplicity which is a primitive trait of Perceval's
character. Later on, after the 'Patrides' adventure (which
appears to be differently related from <b>S.</b> as it is from <b>M.</b>,
Patrides and the lady having fled together, been overtaken,
and imprisoned), both <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree in the words
spoken by Patrides (<b>D. L.</b>) or the king (<b>1533</b>), <i>i.e.</i> that
Kay and Mordred have driven from court one who should
be a better knight <i>than all save Gawain</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Ghi hebt entrouwen, dat secgic u,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Uter herbergen verdreven nu</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Den besten ridder dier in was</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sonder Walewein sijt seker das.</i>'&mdash;ll. 36247-50.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(<b>1533</b> says 'When he is grown to manhood' he shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
be as good, etc.) This certainly points to an earlier stage
of tradition, when Perceval and Gawain are the leading
knights and Lancelot subordinate to both.</p>

<p>In view of what we now know, I think it is not an
unreasonable hypothesis that these two versions, which
agree so closely, represent an earlier pseudo-Borron
<i>Lancelot-Perceval</i> redaction, which has been worked over
in the interest of the later pseudo-Map <i>Galahad</i> version.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> <b>M.</b> gives the account of Lancelot's frenzy and
subsequent cure. Here <b>D. L.</b> agrees with <b>M.</b> in saying that
Lancelot strikes the shield as if <span class="smcap">X.</span> knights did it, whereas
both <b>S.</b> and <b>1533</b> give <span class="smcap">XII.</span> Later on <b>D. L.</b> is alone against
the other three in saying that Lancelot has only his ankles
fettered, whereas the other three versions give ankles and
wrists. Nevertheless here I think <b>D. L.</b> is right, as when
Lancelot rushes after the boar both <b>S.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree in
saying that he breaks the rings on his ankles, and make
no mention of those on the wrist. Again <b>D. L.</b> makes no
mention of hunters, the horse Lancelot takes he finds tied
at the castle gate. As later on, when he comes up with the
quarry no hunters are mentioned in any version, I think it
probable that they were not in the original, but introduced
later by some copyist to account for the boar.</p>

<p>At this point <b>D. L.</b> departs abruptly from the other
versions, taking up the Perceval story. It is impossible to
say whether this be due to a <i>lacuna</i> in the source, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the compiler filled up as he pleased, or whether this really
represents an important (and apparently lost) <i>Lancelot</i>
redaction. In the remainder of the incidents represented
by this book <b>1533</b> agrees on the whole with <b>S.</b>, with this
important difference, that it makes it quite clear throughout
that there is a period of some years involved. The
reader quite understands all the details of Galahad's
arrival at the abbey, his age, etc. Very probably the
compiler of <b>1513</b> (Dr. Sommer's source) condensed here,
as elsewhere, thus causing the confusion noted on p. 205
of the <i>Studies</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center">THE QUESTE VERSIONS</p>


<p>We now reach a very important point in our investigation.
The <i>Lancelot</i> section of Malory is not only so much
condensed, but also so fragmentary in character, and, apparently,
so capricious in choice of incident that a critical
comparison between the version there offered and other
forms of the <i>Lancelot</i> story can never be productive of a
completely satisfactory result. It is one of those cases in
which we must be content with probability, and renounce
the hope of arriving at certainty. We have evidence
enough to enable us to form an hypothesis as to the
<i>original</i> character of the <span class="smcap">MS.</span> used by Malory; of its actual
condition, whether complete or incomplete, and, if the
former, of the reasons which determined the compiler in his
choice of incident, we cannot yet speak positively. I
doubt if we shall ever be able to do so.</p>

<p>But with the <i>Queste</i> section it is different. As I remarked
before, this part of the <i>Lancelot</i> cycle is far more homogeneous
in structure than the sections preceding or following
it: it is a romance within a romance, complete and rounded
off in itself. Malory appears to have felt this; he condenses
still, it is true, but it is condensation, not omission;
he follows the sequence of incident accurately, begins with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the beginning, ends with the end, consequently we are in
a far better position for comparing his version with that
of the other texts, and can hope to arrive at a really
satisfactory result.</p>

<p>The first noticeable variant is in the passage 'for of a
more worthyer mans hande may he not receive the order
of knyghthode,' words spoken by the abbess to Lancelot.
These are not in <b>Q.</b> but are in <b>D. L.</b>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Ende ic soude gerne sien dathi</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Van uwer hant ridder werde, wildi;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bedie van beteren man, sonder waen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>En mocht i ridderscap niet ontfaen.</i>'&mdash;Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> 61-64.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Also in <b>1533</b>: 'car de plus preudhomme que de vous ne
pourrait il recevoir l'ordre de chevalerie sicomme il nous
est advis,' vol. iii. fo. 67. Here then <b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>
agree together against <b>Q.</b> <b>W.</b> has 'for we think that a
better than he could not receive that dignity,' thus referring
the phrase to Galahad&mdash;a probable misreading of the
original French.</p>

<p>In the account of the arming of Galahad, omitted in <b>M.</b>,
<b>Q.</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree in saying that <i>Lancelot</i> buckles on
one spur, <i>Bohort</i> the other, whereas <b>1533</b> gives <i>Lionel</i>
and <i>Bohort</i>. This latter is, I think, the right version,
otherwise Lionel, though present, would have no share in
the ceremony. <b>W.</b> also omits Lionel, and makes Bohort
only bestow a kiss on the youth, Lancelot buckling on the
spur, in this case one only.</p>

<p>In the adventure of the sword in the stone we again
find <b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> in accord against <b>Q.</b> All
three relate that Gawain attempts to draw the sword and
fails. This must be correct, as <b>Q.</b>, though not saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
he makes the attempt, represents Arthur as telling him to
<i>laissies ester</i> the moment he touches the hilt, words
which both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> place in Arthur's mouth after
the attempt:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">'<i>Nu laet staen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gi hebet wel min bevelen gedaen.</i>'&mdash;ll. 231-2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This latter phrase is evidently represented by <b>M.</b>: 'I
thanke yow &#383;aid the kynge to &#383;yre Gawayne /' <b>W.</b>
records Gawain's (Gwalchmei's) attempt, but not the
king's speech.</p>

<p>According to <b>1533</b> no other knight makes the attempt.
<b>D. L.</b> records Perceval's failure, and says that after that
none would essay the venture.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Soe datmen vord daer niemanne vant,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Die daer an wilde doen die hant.</i>'&mdash;ll. 255-56.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I suspect that <b>M.</b>, 'Thenne were there <i>moo</i> that dur&#383;te
be &#383;oo hardy to &#383;ette theire handes thereto /,' should be
corrected by the substitution or insertion of a negative (<i>no</i>
before <i>moo</i> or <i>none</i>), it would read more coherently. <b>W.</b>
relates no attempt after Perceval, but does not say definitely
that no one essays the feat.</p>

<p>The result here is clearly, <b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b> against <b>Q.</b>,
with special agreement of <b>M.</b> and <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b> and <b>W.</b><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>In the case of Galahad's message to his relations at
Corbenic, every one of the versions gives a different
rendering.</p>

<p><b>M.</b> My graunt sir Kynge Pelles / and my lord Petchere /
(a manifest error).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Q.</b> Mon oncle le roi Pelles / mon aioul le riche pescheoure.</p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> Min here den Coninc Pelles&mdash;enten Coninc
Vischere min ouder vader.</p>

<p><b>1533.</b> Mon oncle le roy pescheur&mdash;et mon aieul le roi
Pelles.</p>

<p>The greeting is omitted in <b>W.</b></p>

<p>It is difficult to know what to make of such confusion,
but of the four variants I prefer the last as possessing a
certain <i>raison d'être</i>. The Fisher King was certainly the
uncle of the original Grail Winner, and King Pelles is as
certainly the grandfather of Galahad. It looks to me as if
the compiler of this version had made an effort to combine
the Perceval and Galahad stories, though his version as it
stands is in contradiction to his text.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> text should be noted as compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
statement of the earlier section, that the Maimed King and
Fisher King are one, and that the personage thus named
is <i>not</i> King Pelles but his father. The manifest uncertainty
of the Galahad <i>Queste</i> as to the identity of this personage,
and his relationship to the Grail Winner, as compared with
the much clearer statements of the early Perceval story
appear to me a proof of the lateness of the former. As to
which of the four versions given represents the real view of
the author of the <i>Queste</i>, I should not like to hazard an
opinion&mdash;probably copyists altered according to their own
particular view of the matter!</p>

<p>After the appearance of the Grail there is an interesting
passage, omitted in <b>M.</b>, where Gawain remarks that each
has been served with whatever food or drink he desired,
which had never happened before save in the court of the
<i>roi mehaignet</i> (<b>Q.</b>); <i>roi Perles</i> (<b>1533</b>, which generally
adopts this spelling), <i>coninc Vischer</i> (<b>D. L.</b>). Here <b>Q.</b>
stops, but <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> continue Gawain's speech, <i>nom-pourtant
ils ne peuvent onques veoir le sainct vaisseau ainsi
comme nous l'avons veu, ainsi leur a este la semblance
couverte</i> (vol. iii. fo. 69). <i>Maer si waren bedrogen in dien,
Dat sijt niet oppenbare mochten sien</i> (687-8). Nevertheless,
since he has not seen it as clearly as he might, he will go
in quest till it be wholly revealed to him. I think the
above passage is the source of <b>M.</b> '/ one thynge begyled
vs we myght not &#383;ee the holy Grayle / it was &#383;oo precyou&#383;ly
couered /.' The compiler omits, as I said above, Gawain's
reference to the previous appearance, but adapts the latter
part of his speech to the circumstances he is narrating.
<b>W.</b> gives the passage practically in its entirety, but so freely
rendered that we cannot use it for textual comparison.
The king is called King Peleur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again I think we may postulate an agreement between
<b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b> and <b>W.</b> in a feature omitted by <b>Q.</b><a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> is alone against the other three in not giving the
owner of the castle 'Vagan' the same name as his castle,
but simply says: 'Nu was een goet man te Vagan' (l. 1146),
which I suspect is the right version. <b>W.</b>, on the contrary,
does not name the castle, but says it belonged to <i>Bagan</i>,
'a good and religious man.'</p>

<p>In the account of the adventure with the shield, both
<b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> give Galahad's remarks to his companions
more fully than do <b>Q.</b> or <b>M.</b>, though the general
bearing of the passage is well represented in this latter. In
both the first Galahad tells his companions that if they
fail in the adventure then he will attempt it; <b>1533</b>, 'et se
vous ne le pouez emporter ie l'emporteray, aussi n'ay ie
point d'escu'; they then offer to leave him the adventure,
but he tells them they must essay it first. <b>D. L.</b>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Elst nu dat gi falgiert daer an,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ic sal daventure proven dan&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In' brachte genen scilt met mi.</i>'&mdash;ll. 1244-54.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With this <b>W.</b> agrees.</p>

<p>Here, again, <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b>, and <b>W.</b> give a much clearer
text than <b>Q.</b>; and <b>M.</b>, though condensing, agrees closely in
substance with the two first.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>In the adventure with Melians de Lile, <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>
again all agree against <b>Q.</b> in stating that he is son to the
King of Denmark (<b>W.</b> King of Mars), thus motiving
Galahad's lecture on the duties of his high station. It was
certainly in <b>Q.</b>'s original, as he says: '<i>Puis ke vous estes&mdash;de
si haute lignie comme de roy</i>,' though Melians has not told
him his parentage.</p>

<p><b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b>, and <b>W.</b> are here superior to <b>Q.</b></p>

<p>In avenging Melians on the knight who has overthrown
him, <b>M.</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree in saying that Galahad smites
off the whole left <i>arm</i>, as against the '<i>poing</i> senestre' of
<b>Q.</b> and <b>1533</b>. <b>W.</b> says he cuts off his <i>nose</i>!</p>

<p>In the symbolic interpretation of Melians' adventure,
<b>1533</b> gives the fullest and clearest version. The right-hand
road represents the Way of Our Lord, wherein His
knights 'cheminent de iour et de nuyt la nuyt selon l'arme
et le iour selon le corps,' <b>1533</b> (vol. iii. fo. 74), which is
intelligible. <b>Q.</b> exactly reverses this: 'entrent de jours selon
l'arme, et de nuis selon le corps.' <b>M.</b> gives, 'For the way
on the ry&#442;t hand betokeneth the hyghe way of our lord
Jhe&#383;u Cry&#383;te / and the way of a true good lyver /'; <b>W.</b>,
'On that road go the souls of the innocent,' thus evading
the difficulty. <b>D. L.</b> is here very confused, and does not
seem to have understood the passage.</p>

<p>In the adventure of the Castle of Maidens, <b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b>,
and <b>1533</b> again agree in saying that Galahad meets seven
maidens, against one in <b>Q.</b> <b>M.</b>'s '/ Soo moche peple in
the stretes that he myghte not nombre them /' is evidently
a rendering of <b>1533</b>: 'tant de gens que il estoit impossible
de les scavoir nombrer.' <b>D. L.</b> has exactly the same
phrase, but gives '<i>joncfrouwen</i>' instead of '<i>gens</i>,' thus for
once agreeing with <b>Q.</b>, which gives <i>puceles</i>, against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
other two. <b>W.</b> here gives 'maidens,' but in the first
instance has 'a youth.'</p>

<p>A little later, <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> throw light upon an
apparent contradiction between <b>M.</b> and <b>Q.</b>, noted by Dr.
Sommer.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The old man of whom Galahad inquires the
meaning of the adventure is, as Dr. Sommer remarks, the
same who has given him the keys; but <b>M.</b> says he asks
a '<i>preest</i>.' Both <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree in saying that
Galahad asks the old man who brought him the keys,
when he comes to him the second time, if he be a priest,
and is answered in the affirmative. Again, the three agree
in giving seven years as the time the customs have been
established, against the two in <b>Q.</b> <b>W.</b> here agrees in both
points with <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b></p>

<p>It is plain that we must reckon this entire adventure
among the agreements of <b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b>, and <b>W.</b>, though
in one particular <b>D. L.</b> and <b>W.</b> agree with <b>Q.</b></p>

<p>In the account of the fight of Gawayne, Gareth, and
Uwayne, with the seven brethren, both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>
give Gariët (Gaheriet) as the equivalent of Gareth.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>When Lancelot is sleeping before the Grail chapel,
<b>1533</b> clearly states that the servant of the knight who
has been healed takes Lancelot's sword and helmet, as
well as his horse, whereas <b>Q.</b> only mentions the horse;
but says later that Lancelot finds himself 'tot desgarnis de
ses armes et de son cheval.' <b>D. L.</b> also only mentions
the horse at the moment, but a little later on states that
Lancelot is 'sonder scilt ende helm ende part,' thus
practically agreeing with <b>1533</b>. <b>M.</b> differs from both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
saying that it is <i>sword</i>, helm, and horse of which the squire
deprives him. <b>W.</b> here agrees with <b>M.</b></p>

<p><b>M.</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree in omitting the parallel between
Lancelot and the bad servant, in the Parable of the Talents,
which is given by <b>1533</b> and <b>W.</b> But it is a noticeable
feature of both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> that though they give as a
rule a fuller account than <b>M.</b>, both of them shorten very
considerably the improving and 'sermonising' sections
which are such a feature of <b>Q.</b> On the other hand, both
give the adventurous sections in a more accurate and
detailed manner.</p>

<p>Perceval's interview with the recluse, in Book <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>, is
clearer in <b>D. L.</b> than in either of the French versions,
and has some special features of interest.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Thus in <b>Q.</b>
Perceval asks, who was the knight who overthrew him.
He does not know 'ne se ch'est chil qui vint en armes
vermeilles a court' (<i>when</i> he does not say); the recluse
answers, 'Yes,' and she will tell him the 'senefianche.'
In <b>D. L.</b> the passage runs thus: Perceval asks,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'"<i>Oft gi wet wie die riddere es</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dien ic soeke berecht mi des,"</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si gaf hem antwerde daer of;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"Hets die gene die quam int hof</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In sinxen dage, ende die dan</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Die rode wapine hadde an."</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"Nu seldi mi wel berichten des,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Wat betokenessen dat was?</i>"'&mdash;ll. 3229-36.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This seems to me a preferable rendering.</p>

<p><b>W.</b> here hovers between the two versions. The aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
tells Perceval who Galahad is in answer to his question,
as in <b>D. L.</b>, but volunteers the explanation as in <b>1533</b>.</p>

<p>Later on Perceval tells her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Hoe hi gevonnen hadde sijn lant,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ende sijn broder daer in es bleven</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Met sinen liden, mit sinen neven.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"Dat wet ic wel," seit si saen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"Die heilegeest deet mi verstaen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dies ic harde blide was."</i>'&mdash;ll. 3442-47.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is no parallel to this in the other versions, but it
agrees with what we find in <i>Morien</i>; and I think it probable
that the Dutch compiler, who seems to have been
very familiar with the <i>Perceval</i> story, may have introduced it.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The castle at which Perceval is to seek a kinsman is
not named in <b>D. L.</b>, but <b>M.</b> Goothe, <b>W.</b> Goth, and <b>1533</b>
Got, agree against <b>Q.</b> there.</p>

<p>In Perceval's adventure with the Fiend Horse, the text
of <b>1533</b> is again preferable, being clear and detailed
throughout, <i>e.g.</i> whereas when the lady asks Perceval what
he does under the tree, <b>Q.</b> makes him answer, 'Qu'il ne
<i>sent</i> ni bien ne mal mais s'il eust cheval il se leva d'illuec.'
<b>1533</b> gives 'qu'il ne <i>faisoit</i> ne bien ne mal' mais si j'avoye
ung cheval ie m'en iroye d'icy.' <b>W.</b> here agrees with
<b>1533</b>.</p>

<p>After the fight with the dragon, <b>M.</b> tells us that Perceval
'ca&#383;te donne his &#383;held / <i>whiche was broken</i> /.' <b>Q.</b>, agreeing
in the first part, omits this feature; but both <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b> say the shield was not broken, but <i>burnt</i>: 'Der<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
verbernt was wech ende wede' (3886); 'Qui estoit tout
brulé' (<span class="smcap">III.</span> fo. 83). As we have previously been told that
the dragon was breathing forth flame, this is manifestly
correct. <b>W.</b>, describing the fight, says, 'his shield and
breastplate were burnt all in front of him,' and that he
'threw the shield from him burning.' <b>M.</b>, who is condensing
here, omits the fiery breath, hence, I suspect, the <i>broken</i>
instead of <i>burnt</i> shield.</p>

<p>I think we may take this again as agreement of <b>M.</b>,
<b>D. L.</b>, <b>W.</b>, and <b>1533</b> against <b>Q.</b></p>

<p>The 'drois enchanteres vns multeplieres de paroles' of
the French versions, with which <b>M.</b> closely agrees, is in
<b>D. L.</b>:</p>

<p>An amplification probably due to the exigencies of rhyme;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
though as <b>W.</b> gives, 'He was a necromancer, who of one
word would make twelve without ever saying a word of
truth,' the original source may have had something similar.</p>

<p><b>M.</b>, <b>D. L.</b>, and <b>W.</b> again agree against <b>Q.</b> and <b>1533</b> in
giving a shorter version of Perceval's prayer, and omitting
all New Testament references.</p>

<p>The adventure of the dead hermit, in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span>, is,
again, better told in <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> than in <b>M.</b> or <b>Q.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Thus <b>Q.</b> omits to state the nature of the supposed transgression,
which is clearly set forth in the other three:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Maer hine es niet, donket mi,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Na sire ordinen gebode,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Noch na onsen herre Gode;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Want hi niet heden den dach</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In sulken abite sterven ne mach,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hine hebbe bi enegen onmaten</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sine ordine nu gelaten.</i>'&mdash;ll. 4780-87.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is evidently the source of <b>M.</b>'s 'this man that is dede
oughte not to be in suche clothynge as ye see hym in / for
in that he brake the othe of his ordre /.' <b>W.</b> gives the
same reason at greater length.</p>

<p>Later on <b>M.</b> seems to have had before him a reading
nearer to <b>Q.</b>: in the morning, 'il trouuerent sans faille le
preudhomme <i>de vie</i>,' which <b>M.</b> understood as <i>alive</i>, since
he says, 'he laye all that nygt tyl hit was daye in that
fyre and was not dede /,' though immediately afterwards
he says that the Hermit came and found him dead.
<b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> say, 'Ende alse dat vier utginc si
vonden Den goeden man doet tien stonden,' ll. 4915-16;
'ilz trouverent sans nulle faulte le preudhomme mort.'
The miracle consisting in the fact that his garments (<i>e.g.</i>
the linen shirt) were untouched by fire, so that he
evidently had died from the previous ill-usage, not from
the burning&mdash;a result which he had predicted. <b>W.</b>, on
the contrary, says that 'when the fire was extinguished the
man was as lively as he was before. And then he prayed
Jesus Christ to take his soul to Him, and He received him,
without injury to the shirt or himself.' The whole adventure
should be carefully compared, and the superiority
of these three versions will be clearly seen. The two first are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
I think, the correct version of the incident, but <b>W.</b>, though
rendering freely, gives a fuller account than is often the case.</p>

<p>The list of Celidoine's descendants agrees in <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b>, while <b>M.</b>, though varying from the other three, leans
rather to these two than to <b>Q.</b>:</p>

<p>I think here the second name is certainly Nasciens, and
that the mysterious <i>Cham</i> of <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> (a personage
whom we do not know) ought probably to be <i>Alain</i>. Such
a mistake might easily be made by a copyist, if the <span class="smcap">MS.</span>
before him were not clear and he was unfamiliar with Grail
traditions. I think it very likely that <b>M.</b>'s source was
much the same as that of <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>, and that he
dropped out <i>Cham</i>, but the comparison of the four versions
is interesting. The list is omitted in <b>W.</b></p>

<p>The black and white knights are treated by <b>D. L.</b> as
purely visionary and symbolic, and no names are given.</p>

<p>The incident of the black knight, who issues from the
lake and kills Lancelot's horse, differs in <b>1533</b> from the
other four versions. Instead of striking the horse at once
he rides past Lancelot without touching him, then returns,
striking the horse <i>en route</i> and disappearing in the lake.
I suspect that this is the right version; the knight is
evidently a water-demon, and having his dwelling in the
lake should return there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>At the commencement of Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, when Gawain and
Hector meet, they ask if any tidings have been heard of
the principal questers. Here there are some interesting
variants: <b>Q.</b> mentions Lancelot, Galahad, and Bohort, but
says these <i>four</i> are the best of the questers; <b>D. L.</b> only
mentions these, but says rightly these <i>three</i>; <b>1533</b> first
mentions Lancelot alone, then Galahad, Perceval, and
Bohort, and reckoning all together, says these <i>four</i>, and
with this <b>M.</b> and <b>W.</b> agree.</p>

<p>There are but few interesting variants in the account of
Bohort's adventures; the symbolic interpretations are, as
usual, much less insisted upon, indeed <b>1533</b> gives no
such explanation either of the disinherited lady, or of the
'lily and dry wood' vision, though Bohort is assured of
Lionel's safety. The fight between the two brothers is also
more briefly told: we do not hear that they lie long unconscious
after the flame descends, but Bohort is told at once
to join Perceval. Here <b>W.</b> agrees with <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>.</p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> differs from all the other versions in naming the
damsel who warns Bohort of her mistress' suicidal intention.
She is called Pallada.</p>

<p>In Book <span class="smcap">XVII.</span>, in all concerning the mysterious ship, the
text of <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> is far superior to that of <b>Q.</b> The
inscription in <b>D. L.</b> runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Hort man, die wils gaen hier in,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Besie di wel, ende oec merc</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dattu sijs geloves vol ende sterc.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Want ic els niet dan gelove ben</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hier bi hoede elkerlijc hem:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Falgiert hem eneger maniren</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Van gelove, ic sal hem falgiren.</i>'&mdash;ll. 7910-16.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>1533</b> says the inscription is in 'langaige dit <i>Caldeu</i>,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and says 'si tost q tu guerpiras ta creance ie te guerpiray en
telle maniere que tu ne auras de moi ne conseil ne ayde,'
and proceeds to explain (which no other text I have consulted
does) that if he who enters fail in faith he will fall
into the water. This should be compared with the passage
in Hucher,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> where the inscription on the ship agrees closely
and is also said to be in Caldiu. The warning as to the
nature of the penalty is omitted here, but the penalty is
incurred exactly as <b>1533</b> foretells.</p>

<p><b>M.</b> evidently had the warning of <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>
before him when he wrote 'for and thou faile I shal not
helpe the /.' <b>W.</b> gives the warning in more general terms,
due perhaps to the translator.</p>

<p>Perceval's speech on entering the ship is again best given
by <b>1533</b>. Here, he says, he will enter 'pour ce que se
ie suis desloyal que ie y perisse comme desloyal, et se ie
suis plain de foy et tel comme bon chevalier doit estre que
ie soye sauvé,' <i>i.e.</i> he submits to the test in all humility.
<b>Q.</b> says: 'Car iou sui plain de foi et teus comme chivalers
doit estre,' thus omitting the qualifying phrases, and giving
the speech quite a different meaning. <b>W.</b> closely agrees
with <b>Q.</b> <b>D. L.</b> also, though less abrupt, practically agrees
with <b>Q.</b>; while <b>M.</b> must have had the version of <b>1533</b>
before him: 'for yf I be a nys creature or an untrue knyghte
there shalle I perysshe'&mdash;a reading he could not possibly
have derived from either of the other two.</p>

<p>In the account of the scabbard of the sword we have a
most interesting variety of readings, but, comparing one
with the other, it appears certain that here again <b>1533</b> is
in the right.</p>

<p>One side of the scabbard is said by <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<b>M.</b> to be red as blood, with an inscription in letters black
as a coal; while <b>Q.</b> says the scabbard is 'black as pitch'&mdash;an
evident confusion with the inscription. <b>W.</b> says the
sheath is 'rose-red,' with letters of gold and silver.</p>

<p>The name is given differently in each instance: <b>Q.</b>,
memoire de <i>sens</i>; <b>D. L.</b>, Gedinkenesse van <i>sinne</i>; <b>M.</b>,
meuer of <i>blood</i>; 1533, memoire de <i>sang</i>. <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b> go on to say that 'none shall look upon that part
of the scabbard which is made of the Tree of Life but they
shall be reminded of the blood of Abel.' <b>M.</b> omits the
latter part of this sentence, thus making great confusion.</p>

<p>Now, comparing these versions together, the right reading
becomes perfectly clear. The scabbard is red, for it was
made (at least one half of it was) of the wood of the Tree
of Life, which, as we are distinctly told, turned red at the
death of Abel; and the inscription '<i>memoire de sang</i>' was
intended to keep this event in mind. The confusion, in
the case of <b>Q.</b> and <b>D. L.</b>, clearly arose from the <span class="smcap">MS.</span> at the
root of the first having had the reading san<i>s</i> for san<i>c</i> or
san<i>g</i> (a reading often met with); a careless copyist, heedless
of the sense of his transcription, wrote <i>se</i>ns and this was
correctly translated by the compiler of <b>D. L.</b> as <i>sinne</i>;
a reading which, however unintelligible in itself, would
probably not strike the compiler (who was certainly an
intelligent writer with a very good knowledge of French)
as absolute nonsense, inasmuch as it was connected with
the 'calling to mind' of the death of Abel. <b>Q.</b>, who
omits this qualifying passage, does make nonsense of
it. In <b>M.</b>'s case the mistake was in the first word, and
probably arose from a confusion between <i>m</i> and <i>uv</i>, which
may very well be due to Caxton; otherwise <b>M.</b> appears
to have had the same version as <b>1533</b>, which, alone, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
preserved it free from error. <b>W.</b> omits the inscription
altogether.</p>

<p>The 'erle Hernox' in <b>M.</b>, Ernous in <b>Q.</b>, is in <b>D. L.</b>
and <b>1533</b> Arnou<i>t</i> and Arnou<i>l</i>. Ernoulf in <b>W.</b></p>

<p>Both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> state that the maiden who shall
cure the lady by her blood must be not only a virgin and
a king's daughter but <i>Perceval's sister</i>. This is neither in
<b>Q.</b> nor in <b>M.</b>, and may perhaps indicate that, as I have
suggested, these two versions belonged to an original
<i>Perceval-Lancelot</i> redaction, from which they introduced
occasional additions to Perceval's share of the <i>Queste</i>, as in
the previous allusion to his having recovered his kingdom
in <b>D. L.</b><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In the account of Lancelot's visit to Corbenic, after being
struck down at the sight of the Grail, <b>Q.</b> says he is discovered
seated (seant) before the door, while the other
three all represent him as lying (lyinge&mdash;licgende&mdash;gisant),
which is certainly more in harmony with the general situation.
<b>D. L.</b> says that when Lancelot recovers and knows
he has lain unconscious fourteen days he bethinks him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Hoe hi hadde gedient den viant</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>.xiiij. jaer, ende pensede te hant,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dat hem onse here daerti dede</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Die macht verlisen in sine lede</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>.xiiij. dage.</i>'&mdash;ll. 9919-23.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereas <b>Q.</b> only says 'qu'il avoit servi l'anemi.' A
meaningless phrase, as it stands. <b>M.</b> agrees with <b>D. L.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
with the exception that he says <i>twenty-four</i> instead of
<i>fourteen</i>, in which he is certainly correct, as Lancelot's
<i>liaison</i> with Guinevere had begun long before the birth
of Galahad. The number may have been altered by the
compiler of <b>D. L.</b> for the exigencies of the rhyme, which
would not admit the original form. <b>1533</b> omits the
passage altogether, condensing considerably at this point.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
<b>W.</b> does not specify whether he were lying or seated, but
agrees with <b>D. L.</b> in giving fourteen years, which rather
looks as if that number may have been in the source of
this latter.</p>

<p>In the account of the questers at Castle Corbenic <b>D. L.</b>
and <b>1533</b> alike clear up a passage which, as it stands, is
obscure in <b>M.</b> and utterly unintelligible in <b>Q.</b> Nine
stranger knights arrive at the castle,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> three being of Gaul,
three of Ireland, and three of Denmark. When they
separate the next day, <b>Q.</b> has this unintelligible passage&mdash;Galahad
has asked the strangers' names&mdash;'et tant qu'il
trouverent estrois de gariles, que claudins li fieus le roi
claudas, en ert li uns et li autre de quel terre qu'il fuissent,
erent asses gentile homme et de haut lignage.'<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> <b>M.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
renders, without any mention of names being asked, 'But
the thre knyghtes of Gaule, one of them hyghte Claudyne,
kynge Claudas sone / and the other two were grete gentylmen'
(which should surely have given Dr. Sommer a clue
to the right rendering of the passage).</p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Ende alsi buten den castele quamen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Vragede elc oms sanders namen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Soedat si worden geware das,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dat van den drien van Gaule was</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Claudijn Claudas sone die een,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ende si vonden van den anderen tween</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dat si waren van groter machte</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ridders, ende van groten geslachte</i>'&mdash;ll. 10601-8.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>1533</b> has, 'Si trouverent que des trois de Gaulle
Claudius le filz au roy Claudas en estoit ung et les autres
estoiet assez vaillans.' It seems clear that <b>M.</b>'s text is
that of <b>D. L.</b> carelessly abridged.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>Both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> conclude the <i>Queste</i> section
with the passage relating the death of the twenty-two
(twenty-four) questers, eighteen of whom fell by the hand
of Gawain; the writing out of the knights' adventures, and
the preservation of the record in the abbey of Salisbury
where Map found them, this latter item being omitted by
<b>1533</b>. This passage is, as a rule, now found at the
beginning of the <i>Mort Artur</i> section, but, I think, it is
clear that its proper place is at the end of the <i>Queste</i>; as
I have pointed out already, the light in which it represents
Gawain is entirely in keeping with that romance, while
it does not agree with either the <i>Mort Artur</i> or the
<i>Lancelot</i>, both of which regard Arthur's gallant nephew
with genuine respect. Further, the drawing up of a record
of adventures is better placed at the end of the section
dealing with the adventures to be recorded than at the
beginning of another. <b>M.</b>'s words, 'alle this was made in
grete bookes / and put up in almeryes at Salysbury /'
coupled with his total omission of any corresponding
passage at the commencement of the next book, seem to
prove that in his source, too, it stood at the end of the
<i>Queste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>What now are the results we may deduce from this
examination of four versions of the Galahad <i>Queste</i>?
First, I think it is clear that the verse translation in <b>D. L.</b>
and the prose <b>1533</b> both offer a text very decidedly
superior to that edited by Dr. Furnivall, and, if Dr. Sommer's
extracts are to be relied on, that represented by the
majority of the printed editions of the <i>Lancelot</i>. Second,
it is equally clear that the text used by Malory stood in
close relation to these two versions. Many variants attributed
by Dr. Sommer to the English compiler, are, it is
now certain, due to his source, in the treatment of which
he shows little sign of intelligence or invention, but rather
a tendency to compression at all hazards, sometimes
omitting the very part of a phrase which was required to
make the whole intelligible. The general tendency of our
examination, therefore, goes to establish the practical
agreement of <b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b> and <b>M.</b>, as against <b>Q.</b> and <b>S.</b>
The version given by <b>W.</b> is so free a rendering, and omits
so many details, that it is scarcely possible to place it. It
seems clear that the <i>original</i> source must have belonged to
the same <span class="smcap">MS.</span> family as the former three, but whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
agreement was with <b>1533</b>, rather than with <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>M.</b>, or <i>vice versa</i>, it is impossible to say.</p>

<p>But how do these three stand as regards each other? On
the whole <b>1533</b> appears to represent the better text, and
it also appears to have preserved signs of an earlier redaction,
yet I do not think it is the direct source of the other
two. We often find <b>D. L.</b> and <b>M.</b> agreeing in details of
numbers and names, as against the other version; certainly
in the case of such a name as Brimol van Pleîche, Bromel
la Pleche, the agreement must be due to a French source
common to both. I should be inclined to postulate some
such scheme as this.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/chart.jpg" alt="Diagram showing an original French version leading
to 1533 and a later French version which in turn leads to both D.L. and M."></img></p>

<p>As will be seen from the summary of <b>D. L.</b> appended
to these studies, both this version and <b>M.</b> show, in the
<i>Lancelot</i> section, a certain <i>plus</i> of incident as against
<b>1533</b>, though these incidents vary in each case. The
relation cannot, therefore, be exactly determined, but I
think there can be no reasonable doubt that for the
<i>Lancelot-Queste</i> section of his compilation Malory used
an <i>Agravain-Queste</i> <span class="smcap">MS.</span></p>

<p>That he had <i>two</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>, one for the <i>Lancelot</i>, another for
the <i>Queste</i>, as Dr. Sommer<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> suggests, is highly unlikely. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
would be too curious a chance that he should in each
case hit on a version so closely corresponding to that of
the two with which we have compared his reading.</p>

<p>This appears to me practically to dispose of the argument,
that Malory had before him a number of episodic
romances, an argument often brought forward;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> the
'Turquine' episode in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, the whole of Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span>,
and the adventure with the damsel of Escalot being
instances in point. Turquine certainly came out of the
<i>Lancelot</i>, as did the lady of Escalot; Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> may have
been an episodic romance, as also the handling of Urre of
Hungary; though this latter, as we shall see, may equally
well be an amplification of an adventure found in the prose
<i>Lancelot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Again, it very greatly limits the probability of Malory's
having elsewhere worked with a free hand, inventing and
rearranging, when we find, as we have done, that numerous
small details, hitherto ascribed to him, are faithful
reproductions of his source. We are justified in cherishing
very serious doubts as to the originality of any marked
deviation from the traditional version of an adventure
which we may find in his compilation.</p>

<p>These arguments, of course, apply most strongly to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
version of the <i>Charrette</i> adventure, the problem of source
of which, so far as Malory is concerned, is absolutely unaffected
by the evidence we have collected. This alone
is certain, there is <i>no proof whatever</i> that he knew anything
of the first part of the <i>Lancelot</i> romance, his treatment of
the Lady of the Lake seems to show that he was absolutely
ignorant of it. He was <i>not</i> in the habit of departing unnecessarily
from his source, his variations as a rule are
slight, and their motive can generally be detected; when,
therefore, we find him giving an entirely different account
of the abduction of Guinevere from that given elsewhere,
the probabilities are all in favour of his reproducing a
separate source, and all against his original invention. So
far as the matter stands in the light of the latest evidence,
the question remains unsolved, with a decided balance in
favour of the theory advanced by M. Gaston Paris, and
against that advocated by Professor Foerster.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Leaving the question of Malory, what may we hold to
be the result of this examination on the problem of the
<i>Queste</i> itself? Is the form in which we possess it practically
the original form, or are we to postulate a series of successive
redactions? I think that every one who has carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
studied the variants given above must have been struck
by the fact that in no case is the question one involving
a variety of incident or even an alteration in sequence.
It is the same story in every case, told in the same order,
in the same words, only certain copies give a fuller and
more coherent version than others. In fact, as I said
above, the variations are the variations of the copyist, not
of the compiler. The one point in which we may postulate
either omission or addition, <i>i.e.</i> the greater or less fulness,
the presence or absence, of the 'improving' sections, is
precisely a point in which we might expect a copyist of a
more or less didactic turn of mind to assert himself; it was
so easy to expand or to contract such passages. And it is
a curious feature that precisely in those versions in which
the <i>story</i>, as a whole, is the best told (<b>D. L.</b>, <b>1533</b>, and
in a minor degree <b>M.</b>), we find the edifying passages
in their shortest forms; while <b>Q.</b>, the text of which as
compared with the others is decidedly poor, gives them
at the greatest length.</p>

<p>Of any previous redaction of Galahad's adventures there
is no trace; there are no lengthy interpolations as in the
<i>Conte del Graal</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>; there is no conflict, such as we
find in other romances, between an earlier and later form;
in sundry passages we have allusions to unrelated adventures:
we are told that the heroes ride so many days, weeks,
or years, and meet with many and strange adventures, but
in no copy do we find any hint of what these adventures
may have been; yet had there existed an earlier and fuller
form, some fragments of it must surely have been preserved.</p>

<p>And this argument becomes more convincing the more
closely we look into it. Above we have compared <i>four</i>
versions of the <i>Queste</i> (<i>five</i> if we include <b>W.</b>), but one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
these, Dr. Furnivall's edition, does not represent one <span class="smcap">ms.</span>
only, but is founded on a critical collation of two, and
contains a specimen of the opening columns of twelve <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
of the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>; while Dr. Sommer states
that he has examined four other versions and found that,
saving details of style, all agree in incident and sequence.
We may therefore take it as certain that one of the four
variants represents at least <i>five</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>, while scholars of
standing assure us of the practical identity of sixteen
more!</p>

<p>Now, side by side with these <i>Queste</i> versions, we have
compared four versions of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, and of these
four no two agree perfectly throughout, and all differ from
the summary given by M. Paulin Paris.</p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>, which on the whole correspond well
with each other, yet have their distinctive differences, <i>i.e.</i>
<b>D. L.</b> contains adventures not related by <b>1533</b>; <b>M.</b>, while
on one side condensing arbitrarily, on the other gives two
adventures known to neither of the first; and <b>S.</b> omits
an important section altogether. The summary in <i>Romans
de la Table Ronde</i>, while agreeing on the whole with the
two first, deviates from both in the later sections.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The practical identity of <i>all</i> the versions of a romance
transmitted in so large a number of <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> as the <i>Queste</i> is, I
believe, unique in the Arthurian cycle. Such a phenomenon,
for it is nothing less, can, I think, only be explained in one
way: there was but one version of the story, and that
version took shape, <i>not</i> at a period when <i>oral</i> transmission
was the rule, but at a later date, when the story could at
once find expression in literary form. I do not believe
that any story, the earlier stages of which were developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
<i>orally</i>, is ever, when committed to writing, found so entirely
free from variants.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Can we decide what special form of the Perceval <i>Queste</i>
the Galahad variant was intended to supersede? I think
not: it is noticeable that the writer never gives any adventure
which finds an exact parallel in the older romances,
yet he not only knew the Perceval story, but knew it in
various forms. The allusions in Book <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>, though slight,
are remarkably instructive: he knew that Perceval was the
son of a widow, and that his mother died of grief at his
departure (Chrétien, Wolfram, Didot <i>Perceval</i>); that in his
wanderings in search of the Grail he came to the dwelling
of a female recluse, who proved to be a near relative (only
related by Wolfram); that he has a sister (Didot <i>Perceval</i>,
and <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>). Thus in these few allusions he
is in touch with the whole cycle of Perceval romance!
When, therefore, we find that he never elsewhere assigns
to Perceval any of the adventures traditionally connected
with him, but gives him a new series which are duplicated
elsewhere, one can only conclude that it is done of set
purpose.</p>

<p>Of the parallels given above, the existence of the sister
appears to me to be the most important, judging from the
prominence of the rôle here assigned to her. She only
appears in the two forms of the Perceval <i>Queste</i> which show
traces of having formed part of a cycle; and inasmuch as
<i>Perceval li Gallois</i> represents the mother as living to see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
son return, and regain his kingdom, the correspondence
is closer with the Didot <i>Perceval</i>, but the question can
hardly be settled.</p>

<p>As a <i>Grail</i> romance the <i>Queste</i> is extremely poor. The
utter confusion of the writer as to the identity of the Fisher
King and Maimed King; the inter-relation of Grail Winner,
owner of Grail Castle, Fisher King and Maimed King;
the neglect of the most obvious conditions of the quest,
such as ignorance on the part of the predestined Grail
Winner; his giving proof of identity by fulfilment of a test;
the inaccessibility of the Grail castle to all but the elect
knight&mdash;all show a most extraordinary carelessness on his
part, were he intending to write a Grail romance pure and
simple. Ignorance we cannot postulate. He knows too
much about Perceval not to know more about the Grail!
It is evident throughout that the main anxiety of the author
is to keep himself in touch with the <i>Lancelot</i> rather than
with the <i>Grail</i> tradition. He is extremely careful to introduce
references to that portion of the <i>Lancelot</i> story with
which he is familiar; to explain that the adventures
foreshadowed in <i>Grand S. Graal</i> and <i>Lancelot</i> have been
really fulfilled, and so long as he can demonstrate his
hero to be a worthy upholder of the glories of the race of
King Ban, he cares very little if he fails to fulfil the necessary
conditions of the original Grail Winner. This latter
may know from the first what the Grail is, where it is, his
own predestined relation to it, his final winning it may be
reduced to an absurdity by the presence of eleven or twelve
others all equally worthy of beholding the sacred talisman,
but that matters nothing to the author; he has contrived to
bring the Grail into more or less harmony with the <i>Lancelot</i>
legend; he has crowned the most popular of Arthur's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
knights with reflected glory as father of the Grail Winner,
he has put the last touch to the evolution of the <i>Lancelot</i>
legend, and in so doing he has achieved the task which
he set himself to perform. The <i>Queste</i> is in all essential
features not a <i>Grail</i> but a <i>Lancelot</i> romance, and as such
primarily it should be judged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center">THE MORT ARTUR</p>


<p>This, the final section of the <i>Lancelot</i> cycle, offers less
opportunity for criticism. The versions of <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b>, though still closely in accord with each other, differ
much less from the summary given by Dr. Sommer, and
show less affinity with Malory.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>So far as Malory is concerned I differ from Dr. Sommer,
who says that 'he cannot have derived his account from
the prose <i>Lancelot</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> On the contrary I think there is
little doubt that Malory had the latter portion of the
<i>Lancelot</i> before him, but dislocated it by the introduction
of the <i>Charrette</i> and <i>Urre of Hungary</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> episodes, which he
most probably knew in an independent form; though of
course, as I have suggested above, it is quite possible
that some <i>Lancelot</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> may have included the latter.
But considering the clear proof that the English compiler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
was following an <i>Agravain</i> <span class="smcap">MS.</span> for the earlier part of his
<i>Lancelot</i> adventures, and that he includes the Astolat
and Patryse stories, which are a part of the ordinary
<i>Mort Artur</i><a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> section, I see no reason to doubt that his
<i>Lancelot</i> <span class="smcap">MS.</span> represented <i>all</i> the latter part of the cycle
(as we know he had, and followed, an alternative
version of the <b>M. A.</b> proper). I have carefully compared
both <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> with the abstract given in
the <i>Studies</i>, and give the following as the most important
of the variants, but I should like to make it clearly understood,
both as regards this and the previous sections, that
the instances I quote by no means represent <i>all</i> the points
of contact and departure to be noted between the different
versions. I have many others in my notes, and a critical
edition will certainly very much strengthen the case I have
here stated in outline.</p>

<p>As we have before noted, <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> agree against
<b>S.</b> in incorporating with the <i>Queste</i> the passage generally
given as the opening of <b>M. A.</b> Otherwise all three
versions are in practical agreement as regards the events
leading up to the tournament at Winchester. <b>D. L.</b> does
not mention Hector when Lancelot inquires on which
side his kinsmen are fighting, but only Bohort and Lionel.
<b>1533</b> agrees here with <b>S.</b></p>

<p>According to <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> Gawain and Gaheriet
take no part in the fighting at Arthur's desire: he fears
they may fight with Lancelot, and ill-will arise from it.
<b>S.</b> does not mention this, so I cannot say if it be in the
<b>1513</b> edition or not.</p>

<p><b>S.</b> says, 'The people think the two knights' (Lancelot
and his comrade) 'cannot be the sons of the lord of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
castle of Escalot.' This does not agree with the other
versions: the people think they <i>are</i> the lord's sons at
first; then <i>Gawain</i> says, one of them cannot be. <b>D. L.</b>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Ende man waende daer wel dat Lanceloet</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ware een vanden broderen van Scaerloet.</i>'&mdash;ll. 851-2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and Gawain proceeds to say, 'This knight with the red
sleeve is not he whom I thought, no one ever saw such
valour by one of the "Kinder van Scaerloet."' Arthur
asks what knight he may be. <b>D. L.</b> makes Gawain say
simply he does not know, 'but he is certainly a good
knight'; while <b>1533</b> goes on to add 'if Lancelot had
not been left at Kamalot he would have said that this
was he.' This does not at all agree with <b>S.</b></p>

<p>Both <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> agree against <b>S.</b> in saying Lancelot's
wounds will take six (not seven) weeks to heal.</p>

<p>When Gawain and Gaheriet follow Lancelot, <b>S.</b> says
they meet a <i>wounded</i> knight; in <b>1533</b> the knight is dead.
<b>D. L.</b> omits the incident.</p>

<p>When Gawain returns to Arthur, <b>S.</b> represents the king
as saying 'it was not the first time he took trouble without
results, nor will it be the last.' <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> here add
'<i>through that knight</i>,' which is evidently correct.</p>

<p><b>S.</b> simply says the second tourney is fixed at Tanebor,
'du lundi dapres en ung moys'; whereas the other versions
carefully specify the wherabouts of this place, 'dat een
casteel es, Staende in den inganc van Nortgales.' <b>D. L.</b>
spells it 'Caneborch.'</p>

<p>Again, according to <b>S.</b>, Lancelot, unable to go to the
tourney, sends greeting to the queen and Gawain, 'from
the knight who wore the red sleeve'; whereas <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b> say 'the knight who won the tournament at Win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>chester'
and make no mention of the sleeve, which,
considering the relations between Lancelot and Guinevere,
seems to me the better version. Neither do these mention
that Guinevere tries to persuade Bohort to return to
Camelot.</p>

<p>When Gawain comes to Escalot <b>S.</b> represents him as
admiring the maiden's beauty and envying the knight
'with the red sleeve.' <b>1533</b> says, more correctly, 'the
knight who wins her love'; he has not yet learned to whom
the sleeve belonged.</p>

<p>In the account of what happens after Gawain's return to
court, and Guinevere's learning the truth, all the versions
agree on the whole, and it is noticeable that <b>M.</b>, though
making Bohort a more energetic defender of his cousin's
good faith, yet correctly reproduces all the main features
of incident and speech. I think any one comparing his
version closely with two or three others can hardly fail to
come to the conclusion that it is the prose <i>Lancelot</i> and no
other account he is reproducing.</p>

<p>According to <b>S.</b> Lancelot's kinsmen only remain for
a week at court; according to <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> it is 'that
week and the next.'</p>

<p>When they leave the court on the second occasion after
the tournament of Tanebor, neither <b>D. L.</b> nor <b>1533</b> say
(as <b>S.</b> does) that the queen tries to persuade Bohort to
remain, though they agree in making her regret his
departure.</p>

<p>After Lancelot's return to court when Bohort lectures
Guinevere on the mischief done by women, with reference
to David, Solomon, etc., <b>D. L.</b> omits the reference to
Tristan, while <b>1533</b> amplifies it by saying 'it is not five
years since Tristan died for love of Iseult.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> omits all reference to Lancelot's being wounded
in the wood, condensing considerably at this point, and
gives no account of the arrival of the dead body of the
maiden of Escalot.</p>

<p>In the account of how Lancelot learns of the queen's
danger from Madoc de la porte, all three versions differ.
According to <b>S.</b> he meets a knight from Kamalot who
tells him of the queen's plight, and at once resolves to
rescue her. <i>The next day</i> he meets Hector and reveals
his intentions; and a few days after both meet Bohort, who
asks if they know the news. <b>1533</b> says that as the first
knight rides off, Hector appears from a cross-road; he is
on his way to defend Guinevere.</p>

<p>In <b>D. L.</b> it is not said how Lancelot first learns the
news, but he meets Hector and Bohort together, and on
their asking him if he has heard, replies in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I suspect <b>M.</b> had a version akin to this last before him
as he makes <i>Bohort</i> Lancelot's informant.</p>

<p>In the account of the final detection of Lancelot and
Guinevere, <b>S.</b>, as I have before pointed out, goes wrong,
by substituting <i>Guerreshes</i> for <i>Gariët</i>. All the texts I have
consulted agree in stating that it is this latter who sides
with Gawain, and refuses to be a party to the betrayal.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> omits the fact that Arthur hears of Lancelot's
victory at the tournament of Cahere; and also the remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of Bohort that only Morgain or Agravain can have
betrayed him.</p>

<p>In the details of the detection all three versions agree
closely.</p>

<p>In the account of Guinevere's trial <b>S.</b> again diverges
from the others. We read<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> 'Arthur decides to punish
Guinevere with death. He will have her tried at once.
<b>P. L.</b> introduces here, and a little later, a certain
"roy Yon" who counsels moderation. The trial takes
place; Arthur, with Gaheriet, Mordred, and Agravain,
doom the queen to the stake.' I do not know if this
accurately represents the text <b>1513</b>, it certainly differs
widely from the reading of <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>.</p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> does not mention Yon; <b>1533</b> simply introduces
him as telling Arthur that the trial cannot take place
that evening, while both agree in saying that <i>Gawain</i>
(whom <b>S.</b> does not mention at all) warns the king not to
proceed to extremities, threatening to give up all his lands
if the queen be burnt. Mordred and Agravain doom the
queen to death, Arthur <i>alone</i> specifies the nature of that
death.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>In the account of the fatal fight at the stake, <b>D. L.</b>
represents Lancelot as slaying both Gawain's brothers,
while <b>1533</b> agrees with <b>S.</b> in saying that Bohort kills
Guerresches and Lancelot Gaheriet. <b>M.</b>, it will be remembered,
agrees in this with <b>D. L.</b> It may be noted
that all three, <b>1533</b>, <b>D. L.</b>, and <b>M.</b>, while making no
remark about Guerresches, especially lament Gaheriet: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
two first say that Lancelot knows Gawain will never forgive
him for this, and <b>M.</b> speaks of him as 'the noble knyghte,'
making the identity with Gareth quite clear.</p>

<p>The castle at which the queen and Lancelot stay <i>en
route</i> for Joyous Garde, called <i>Scalee</i> by <b>S.</b>, <i>Scalle</i> in
<b>1533</b>, and <i>Calet</i> in <b>D. L.</b> does not, I think, belong
to Keux the seneschal, as <b>S.</b> supposes; <b>D. L.</b> does not
mention him, and <b>1533</b> speaks of '<i>ung Keux</i>,' a friend of
Lancelot's, which cannot be <i>Kay</i>. Both here, and in the
'<i>Keux</i> du Parc' of the Turquine adventure, I suspect that
we have not a proper name at all, but a misreading of
'Queus'=<i>count</i>. In the latter instance <b>D. L.</b> renders
<i>Keux</i> by <i>Grave</i>.</p>

<p>On p. 255, <b>S.</b> must surely have misread his source, as
he says that Lancelot sends messengers to <i>King Ban of
Benoyc</i>, asking his aid. King Ban was of course dead
long before; <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> say to <i>the barons</i> of Benoyc,
which must be the right reading</p>

<p>Again, the summary of the battle, <b>S.</b>, p. 256, differs
very materially from <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b>. <b>S.</b> says Gawain
fights like a madman and kills thirty of Lancelot's men
with his own hand, wounding others, Lionel among them.
The next day there is another battle, in which occurs the
incident of Arthur being unhorsed by Bohort, and remounted
by Lancelot. Now in the other two versions
Bohort and Gawain wound each other so desperately at
the first onslaught that they are carried off the field half
dead, and it is <i>Hector</i> who overthrows Arthur.</p>

<p>Later on, after the return of Guinevere, when <b>S.</b> represents
<i>Hector</i> as challenging Gawain, the other two versions
give <i>Bohort</i>.</p>

<p>After the kinsmen return to Benoyc we find <b>D. L.</b> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
apparent contradiction with the other versions. <b>S.</b> says
that he makes Bohort king of Benoic and Lionel of
Gannes, while he himself keeps the crown of Gaule,
<i>because Arthur gave it to him</i>. <b>1533</b> seems to agree
with this latter phrase, as it says, 'et pour ce que le roy
Artus me donna le royaulme de Gaule ie le tiendray.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
<b>D. L.</b> on the contrary says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Ende vanden conincrike, dat secgic u,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Van Gaule sone doe ic niet nu,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ende ne houder gene tale af,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Om dat mi die coninc Artur gaf;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Want al haddi mi gegeven vor nu</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Al die werelt, dat secgic u,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ic gavese hem al weder te hant,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bedie ic ne soude en geen lant</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nu ter tijt van hem willen houden.</i>'&mdash;ll. 7407-15.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now in the earlier portion of <b>D. L.</b>, after the war with
Claudas, we are told that Lancelot has made Bohort king
of Gannes, Hector of Benoyc, and Lionel of Gaul, an
arrangement which exactly agrees with that which <b>M.</b>
takes from the English <b>M. A.</b> In this earlier passage
Lancelot gives as reason for not taking the crown that he
prefers to remain a simple knight, and <b>1533</b> represents
Bohort and Hector as following his example and declining
the offered kingdoms.</p>

<p>I think the lesson of this discrepancy is that the <i>Lancelot</i>
and the <b>M. A.</b> were fundamentally independent of each
other, and each contained an account of the crowning of
the race of Ban. When brought into close contact this
caused a contradiction of statement which <b>D. L.</b> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<b>1533</b> evaded each in their own way. <b>S.</b> gives no clue
to what happened on the earlier occasion.</p>

<p>The number of knights Arthur takes with him on his
last expedition agrees in <b>D. L.</b> and <b>M.</b>, sixty thousand,
against forty thousand in the two French versions.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>In both <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b>, Guinevere does not, as in
<b>S.</b>, ask for a <i>week's</i> respite, but for a <i>day</i>, and Mordred
himself suggests she shall have the week. <i>Labor</i>, whom
<b>S.</b> calls simply 'a faithful knight,' is in both these versions
a near kinsman&mdash;<i>neve</i>, <i>cousin</i>. <b>D. L.</b> gives as a reason for
Guinevere's rejection of Mordred's offer that she suspects
his true relation to Arthur. This is not in <b>1533</b>.</p>

<p>In the account of the fight between Lancelot and
Gawain, all three versions apparently differ at the outset.
Gawain will send the challenge by a squire. <b>S.</b>, squire
refuses, fearing Lancelot's wrath; <b>1533</b>, refuses, fearing to
bring about Gawain's death; <b>D. L.</b>, goes at once.</p>

<p>The issue of the fight too is different in <b>D. L.</b> and
<b>1533</b>. In <b>S.</b>, Gawain receives a mortal wound in the
head and retreats. In <b>1533</b>, Lancelot appeals to the
king: it is vesper-tide, and a fight for treason must be
concluded by nightfall. Arthur, seeing Gawain is getting
the worst of the battle, stops it at once. <b>D. L.</b> apparently
condenses a similar version, but makes Arthur appeal to
Lancelot, who says that he will be dishonoured if he leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
his foe in possession of the field, but Arthur entreats him
to do so for his sake, and Lancelot retires. Both agree in
saying that Gawain is over twenty years Lancelot's senior,
and is now eighty-two years old!<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><b>D. L.</b> represents the war with Rome as lasting twenty
years, which would make both Arthur and Gawain well
over a hundred at the time of their death!</p>

<p>After the news of Mordred's treachery <b>D. L.</b> makes no
mention of Gawain being carried in a litter on the return
journey, or of his desire for Lancelot's forgiveness; nor
does he warn Arthur against fighting with Mordred. This
is, I suspect, due to the compiler's desire to condense, as
<b>1533</b> agrees in the main with <b>S.</b> The warning against
Mordred appears, however, to be fuller in the former,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>Studies</i>, p. 265. Gawain is represented as saying
briefly, 'Avoid, if possible, fighting with Mordred, for it
will cause your death,' which is in <b>1533</b>, 'Car ie vous dy
vrayement que se vous mourez par une homme [=q] vive
vous mourrez par lui et madame la royne,' p. 154, which
certainly seems to point to an earlier redaction of the
<b>M. A.</b>, where Guinevere was a partner in Mordred's
treason.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>In the description of Arthur's death there are some
interesting variants. Both <b>1533</b> and <b>D. L.</b> account for
Lucan's death by the weight of Arthur's armour; it is
that, and not the vehemence of the king's embrace, which
really kills the sorely wounded knight.</p>

<p>They again differ in the details of the final scene. <b>S.</b>
says 'a boat full of ladies arrives; they land, go ashore,
put Arthur, his horse, and armour into the boat, and row
off.' <b>D. L.</b> says they call Arthur, who rises, takes his
horse and armour, and goes into the ship. <b>1533</b> says
the mistress of the party is Morgain; she calls Arthur, who
rises at sight of her, she takes him by the hand (which
would seem to imply her landing), and bids him bring
horse and arms and enter the boat, which he does. Dr.
Sommer evidently regards the entire account as absurd,
but I not only accept it, but regard the versions of <b>D. L.</b>
and <b>1533</b>, which would merit his strictures more fully
than that in which he finds such difficulty, as representing
the earlier and more primitive form of the story. There
is no doubt that Arthur was conceived of as living and
ruling in Avalon. This account of his practically voluntary
departure for the mysterious island is much more in accord
with that idea than the version which represents him in
the extremity of mortal weakness, and subsequently dead
and buried. Arthur's tomb is <i>not</i> compatible with Arthur
in Avalon, and I strongly suspect that the earlier redaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of the <b>M. A.</b> made no mention of it; it is certainly omitted
in the corresponding section of the Didot <i>Perceval</i>, which
only says he departed to have his wounds healed in
Avalon, and has not since been seen; but Bretons claim
to have heard his horn, and seen his armour, and believe
he will return.</p>

<p>There is a curious discrepancy in the accounts of Lancelot's
death, which seems to point to two distinct versions
of that event. <b>S.</b> says he died August 5th, but does not
say how long he was ill. <b>D. L.</b> says he fell ill on May
15th, and died after four days. <b>1533</b> says he fell ill
May 15th, was ill four days, and died August 5th! Evidently
a combination by some unintelligent compiler of
the two previous accounts, but it is unusual to find such
an obvious <i>bévue</i> in so otherwise admirable a version as
that of <b>1533</b>.</p>

<p>All three agree that Lancelot is buried in Galehault's
tomb, and that Bohort becomes a hermit in his stead.</p>

<p>From the above comparison it seems clear that though
offering less striking and interesting variants, the Dutch
version and that of <b>1533</b> yet maintain, on the whole,
their previous agreement as against <b>S.</b>; while <b>M.</b>, which
here possesses an alternative source the English <b>M. A.</b>,
yet occasionally betrays the same curious agreement with
<b>D. L.</b> which we have noted before. The result appears
to confirm the conclusion previously arrived at, that <b>D. L.</b>
and <b>1533</b> represent a common French original, and that
<b>M.</b>'s source, whether complete or incomplete, was a <span class="smcap">MS.</span>
belonging to the same family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION</p>


<p>We have now reached the final stage of our <i>Lancelot</i>
studies, and it only remains for us to gather up the threads
of the previous investigation, and to endeavour to formulate
the results at which we have arrived. We have seen that
the <i>Lancelot</i> legend was one of remarkably speedy growth.
We find no mention of the hero's name before the latter
half of the twelfth century, yet within ten years of that first
mention he is the most famous of Arthur's knights, and the
lover of the queen.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>We have examined the legend (<i>a</i>) in the form of a loosely
constructed biographical romance, composed of episodes
originally foreign to each other; (<i>b</i>) in detached episodic
poems; (<i>c</i>) in its final form as the most important member
of a great prose cycle; and we have found that in all this
mass of literature the only really distinctive and individual
trait on which we could lay our finger was the story of the
hero being stolen as a child and brought up by the mistress
of a water kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Into the question of the character of the Lady of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Lake we have not entered deeply; we have seen that she
touches on the one side the mysterious queen of the Other
World, on the other the scarcely less enigmatic Morgain le
Fay, King Arthur's sister. The subject was too wide in
extent to be adequately treated in this series; it demands
separate study, but the result, so far as the <i>Lancelot</i> legend
is concerned, was to lead us to believe that the root of that
legend was a <i>lai</i>, presumably Breton, dealing with the theft
of a king's son by a water fairy; a theme which afterwards
underwent considerable expansion, in the course of which
the characters of the hero and of his patroness alike became
greatly modified from the original conception.</p>

<p>The final and best known form of the story was mainly
influenced by the introduction of a <i>motif</i> foreign to the
earlier and tentative development, <i>i.e.</i> that of Lancelot's
love for the wife of his lord. This <i>motif</i>, however, we saw
reason to believe, did not really represent the earlier tradition
of Guinevere's infidelity, but was a practically new
development introduced under the dual influences of a
special social condition and the high popularity of the
earlier <i>Tristan</i> story. As to the reasons which determined
the choice of Lancelot as the queen's lover, we found ourselves
unable to express any decided opinion.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>But from its very earliest stages the <i>Lancelot</i> story came
into contact with another and highly popular tale, the
legend of <i>Perceval</i>. The earlier and later biographical
forms (<i>Lanzelet</i> and the prose <i>Lancelot</i>) and the episodic
romances (<i>Le cerf au pied blanc</i> and <i>Morien</i>) show traces
of contact, direct or indirect, with this story; while the
precise statements of certain <span class="smcap">MSS.</span><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> make it quite clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
that even at an advanced stage of its evolution the <i>Lancelot</i>
legend formed part of a cycle of which the most important
member was the story of <i>Perceval and the Grail</i>.</p>

<p>This continued contact with the <i>Perceval</i> story, with the
resulting developments, appears to be the most important
factor in the evolution of the <i>Lancelot</i> legend, and one
which has hitherto been overlooked.</p>

<p>So far as the evidence at our disposal permits us to
trace it, the course of development seems to have been
the following. Gradually the legend of the <i>Grail</i>,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> originally
foreign to the <i>Perceval</i> story, completely dominated
that story and changed the character of the hero, who
became transformed into an ascetic celibate; while, on
the other hand, the growing popularity of the <i>Lancelot</i> story
had reacted prejudicially on the position alike of Perceval
and the still earlier hero Gawain as knights of King Arthur's
court. Eventually the two competing centres of romantic
interest were <i>Lancelot</i> and the <i>Grail</i>, and it became necessary
to combine them in such a manner that the latter,
while still retaining its sacrosanct character, should yet contribute
to heighten the fame of the popular 'secular' hero.</p>

<p>Such a combination was possible, under certain conditions,
and an ingenious writer, perceiving this possibility,
turned it to account by inventing the Galahad <i>Queste</i>,
which, poor and inadequate as a <i>Grail</i> romance, yet as
a contribution to the <i>Lancelot</i> cycle had a very certain and
decided value. It put the final touch to the evolution of
the hero by enabling him to take part, under circumstances
which should vicariously increase his fame, in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
adventure of the Arthurian cycle, the Grail Quest; it also
restored superficially the unity of the cycle, which had been
injured by the cleavage between the <i>Grail</i> and the other
sections, caused by the growing popularity of Lancelot as
compared with Perceval.</p>

<p>While Gawain and Perceval were the leading heroes of
the Arthurian cycle, a Perceval <i>Queste</i> was natural; but as
soon as these two were supplanted in the popular favour
by Lancelot, the Perceval <i>Queste</i>, as an integral part of the
cycle, became more and more inharmonious. A change
in the interest of the <i>later</i> Lancelot development was
inevitable, and that the change took place precisely at
the psychological moment is, I think, proved by the practically
universal welcome accorded to the Galahad <i>Queste</i>.
With unanimous consent the Perceval <i>Queste</i> appears to
have been discarded <i>as a part of the cycle</i>, although in its
<i>independent</i> form it still retained its popularity.</p>

<p>Naturally all the branches of the cycle into which the new
<i>Queste</i> had been adopted were more or less affected by it;
in some cases the references to the coming Grail Winner
were more or less vague, and would apply as well to the
later as to the earlier hero; in other instances they were
amplified but not altered, thus introducing confusion into
the text (this is, I suspect, the case with the <i>Merlin Suite</i>).
The romances that represented the <i>Early History</i>, as introduction
to the <i>Queste</i>, were naturally the most affected,
and at the present moment it is extremely difficult to decide
whether the <i>Grand S. Graal</i> be a <i>direct</i> amplification of
the <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>, constructed with a view to the
Galahad <i>Queste</i>, or whether, in its existing form, it depends
upon an intermediate version the <i>données</i> of which would
agree with the cyclic <i>Perceval</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case the 'net' result was, I believe, the substitution
of the name of the supposed author of the <i>Queste</i>,
Walter Map, for that of the traditional author of the
earlier <i>Perceval-Grail</i> story, Robert de Borron; and to
ascribe to Map that cyclic redaction of the Arthurian
romances which had previously been ascribed to de Borron.</p>

<p>I think that much of the difficulty hitherto experienced
in determining the order and date of the various Grail
romances has arisen from our very natural tendency to
regard these romances as a group apart, and to compare
them exclusively with each other; whereas they should be
treated as members of the cycle, and compared with the
other branches of the cycle. More especially is this the
case with the Galahad <i>Queste</i>; treated as a <i>Grail</i> romance
proper, it is inexplicable, and appears to represent no
possible step that can be postulated in the <i>natural</i> evolution
of the Grail legend. We could imagine the honour
transferred from father to son (as a matter of fact it is
<i>Lohengrin</i> and not Galahad who should be the successor
to Perceval); but this sudden break in the tradition by
which the honour passes to the race of King Ban, no
relationship between Perceval and Lancelot being previously
hinted at, is, considered in itself, most perplexing.
On the other hand, treat the <i>Queste</i> as an integral part of
the <i>Lancelot</i> cycle, and it not only explains itself, but gives
us valuable assistance in 'placing' the earlier versions.</p>

<p>At the same time it is obvious that the theory here
advanced only applies to the <i>later</i> stages of the Grail
tradition; it does not touch the problem of the origin of
the Grail itself, or its first connection with Perceval.</p>

<p>In the course of our investigation we found it necessary
to devote especial attention to the work of Chrétien de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Troyes, endeavouring to ascertain the exact position which,
in the evolution of the Arthurian romantic cycle, should
be ascribed to this famous poet. It became clear that a
very considerable portion of the matter with which he
dealt belonged by its nature to the domain of what we call
folk-lore; and by reason of that nature could not have
been <i>invented</i> by the poet, but must have ante-dated, in
some instances by many centuries, any possible <i>literary</i>
rendering. Judged by the rules laid down by scientific
authorities on comparative religion, and story-transmission,
Chrétien could not have been an <i>inventor</i>, but only a
brilliantly successful re-teller of stories long known and
popular. Instead of standing at the <i>source</i> of Arthurian
romantic tradition, he was swept into the current at a
comparatively late period of its evolution. To solve the
complex problems of Arthurian romance we must go behind
Chrétien: it is the period preceding, not following, his work
in which the solution of our puzzles must be sought.</p>

<p>To this Chrétien himself bears witness. The position
claimed for him by certain modern scholars is not that
which he claimed for himself; he never professed to be
telling a story no one had ever heard before, though he
may have flattered himself, not without reason, that he was
telling it better than it had ever previously been told. He
was dealing with heroes and adventures already well known
to his public. The manner in which he introduces, or
refers to, incidental characters makes it abundantly clear
that he expected his readers to understand his allusions.
Especially is this noticeable in the case of Perceval, who has
been claimed, with more zeal than discretion, as one of his
most famous creations. He alludes to the hero in a manner
that makes it quite evident that this story was well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and the name familiar, to the public, some decades before
Chrétien himself undertook to tell it.</p>

<p>As practical results arising from these studies I would
claim:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>a</i> That we, in future, place the evolution of the
<i>Perceval</i> story at a much earlier date than we
have hitherto been willing to assign to it.</p>

<p><i>b</i> That we admit the possibility of very important
variations in the tale, some of them being anterior
to Chrétien's version.</p>

<p><i>c</i> That we recognise that this story of Perceval was of
capital importance in the general evolution of
the Arthurian cycle.</p>

<p><i>d</i> That in the mutual relations between the <i>Perceval-Grail</i>
and <i>Lancelot</i> stories we have the key to the
final shaping of the entire cycle.</p></blockquote>

<p>These principles admitted, and I think the evidence
adduced goes far to prove their soundness, it is obvious
that in order to establish and appraise the above relations
at their full value, we must have complete and critical
editions of <i>all</i> the principal texts. As matters stand at
present, the only texts which can be said to have been in
any sense critically treated are the Didot <i>Perceval</i>, and the
<i>Parzival</i> of Wolfram von Eschenbach for the older story,
and the <i>Charrette</i> for the younger. We have been waiting
for years for a critical edition of the <i>Conte del Graal</i>, and
when we get it will the editor have taken into consideration
the various additions to Chrétien's text, and the version
of the Dutch compiler, or will it be Chrétien's portion of
the poem alone? In that case it will not help us very far.
We need sorely a critical edition of the curious <i>Perceval
li Gallois</i>, with its blending of wild, folk-lore features with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
late proselytising and allegorising tendency, its baffling
parallels to the German <i>Parzival</i>.</p>

<p>And if we are at a loss for material to adequately
criticise the earlier story, what of the later? Considering
the highly mythic, prehistoric character of so much of the
Arthurian tradition, the disappearance of so many of the
intermediate stages, and the consequent difficulty in fixing
the <i>earliest</i> form of any characteristic feature, it would
seem that our best plan would be to start from the <i>final</i>
form assumed by the cycle and work gradually backward,
since for a certain period, at least, we might hope to find
solid ground beneath our feet. But the most important
text for this final form of the Arthurian cycle, the prose
<i>Lancelot</i>, remains unedited. And indeed it might well seem
to be a work beyond the powers of any one scholar; the
number alike of <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> and of printed editions is so large;
they are so scattered, no important library but can show
one or more <i>Lancelot</i> texts, and we cannot afford to leave
even <i>one</i> of all this mass unexamined. The great discrepancy
between the printed texts which the foregoing
comparison has shown us; the pregnant hints as to earlier
redactions, which the passages I have quoted from M. Paulin
Paris and Professor Heinzel assure us may be found in the
MSS., are all indications of the vast extent of the task which
confronts us.</p>

<p>Yet this much is certain, until it is boldly grappled
with, and scholars are in possession of a complete critical
edition of the <i>Lancelot</i> in which all the varying adventures
shall be carefully chronicled, and all the traces of earlier
redactions duly noted, any studies such as these in the
preceding pages, be they the work of scholars of the very
first rank, will always be liable to the necessity of revision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
or the risk of subversion, by the accidental discovery of
some hitherto unknown factor.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>This appears to me to be the great and pressing question
which confronts Arthurian scholars; we desire our work to
have a permanent value, yet we are leaving undone that
which, to all appearance, is the surest means of securing
such permanence.</p>

<p>A work of such magnitude can, I think, only be grappled
with by a body of scholars, a chief editor, assisted by a
group of sub-editors. The great extent and diffusion of
the material (the <i>Lancelot</i> <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> are, as I said before,
practically scattered all over Europe), render it impossible
for any one man to hope to complete the task within
a reasonable term of years. I do not know what may be
the principles regarding the choice of publications by the
<i>Sociétié des anciens textes Français</i>, whether their aim be
the introduction to the public of <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> of which unique
copies alone exist, rather than to publish critical editions
of more easily accessible texts; but if the latter should lie
within their province, I cannot imagine any publication
that would be more warmly welcomed by Arthurian
scholars, or that would be of greater interest and more
enduring benefit to the students of mediæval literature, than
a full and complete edition of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>.</p>

<p>(Opens with short introduction alluding to Meleagant, thus
pre-supposing the <i>Charrette</i> adventure.)</p>

<p>Line 20. Eight days after Whitsuntide A., his knights, and
twelve tributary kings are hunting in a forest. Guinevere and
her maidens ride to see hunt escorted by Kay, Segramore,
Dodinel, and Lancelot. Knight rides up and seizes queen's
bridle. Her knights resent this. K., S., and D. are overthrown.
L. is about to joust when maiden rides up and
demands his aid, he is pledged to her. L. asks permission to
fight first; overthrows and badly wounds knight, and follows
maiden. Wounded knight is tended by queen's people.</p>

<p>Line 245. Queen sends K. after L., whom he finds fighting
with two knights; K. gives him his horse; returns to queen.</p>

<p>Line 352. Queen is hungry. Dodinel and Segramore go to
find food. Come to a pavilion with knight, he and S. fight, D.
looks on. Maid on mule rides up, calls D. to go with her.
Knight flies and S. is left alone.</p>

with stick. S. chastises him. Lady appears and reproaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
S., he is struck with her beauty. Enters pavilion and finds
Calogrenant prisoner. He had come there and blown horn at
maid's request, two armed knights appeared and overthrew
him. S. blows horn. Red Knight appears; they fight, well-matched.
A knight arrives, carries off maiden. R. K. begs
truce that he may pursue them. S. will do so too. Cal. is
released (<b>1533</b>, <i>R. K. remains to guard C.</i>). S. pursues ravisher,
comes to hill and fair meadow, ten pavilions by a fountain.
Knight with thirty companions appears and demands joust. S.
overthrows him and asks news of maiden. Knight will tell him
if S. will grant first request asked. Leads him to pavilion with
maid and four knights. Maid will return with S.; has been
brought against her will. A knight throws knife at S. who
cleaves his head with sword. Others attack S., who slays first,
and others fly. Rides off with maid to ten pavilions, ten knights
ride out, S. must go with them to their lord or joust; chooses
latter. They ask his name, he is <i>Segramore die Wonderlike</i>.
Another knight appears, S. must leave maiden or joust. He is
Brandalis, rejoiced to meet S., would entertain him. S. says
he must return to queen who waits by 'Elfin Spring.' B. will
escort maiden to her <i>ami</i>. S. rides off to house of Mathamas
(his original destination), finds him and knights in hall, and
demands provisions for queen. M. and his men treacherously
attack S., finally overpower and throw him into dungeon,
where he is wellnigh starved, but M.'s daughter takes pity
upon him, and brings him food.</p>

<p>Line 1050. <span class="smcap">Dodinel</span> and maid meet knight and lady richly
dressed, with dwarf. D. greets dwarf, who makes no answer
but tries to kiss maiden, who throws him to the ground.
Knight tries to kill maiden, but is unhorsed by D. and sent

knight's head on saddle-bow, asks L.'s name, bids him give
him his armour, L. has pledged himself so to do (reference to

'Griffoen van den quaden passe.' He rides thus past the Elfin
Spring. Queen sees him in L.'s armour with head at saddle-bow
and thinks L. is slain. Kay and other knights pursue him,
and are overthrown, Kay taken prisoner. Queen and maidens

maiden meets them, and says best knight on earth is being
slain. Leads them to a valley where one knight fights against
ten. Gawain and companions rescue him and put others to
flight. Knight has two swords. Gawain asks reason. Knight
explains. He is Eliezer (<b>1533</b>, <i>Helye</i>), son of the rich Fisher
who holds the Grail. One sword is that with which Joseph of
Arimathea was wounded (here adventures of Joseph as in
<i>G. S. Graal</i>); it is broken and can only be mended by him
who achieves adventures of the Grail. Ywein begs E. to
accompany them in their search for Lancelot, he would doubtless
fulfil the test. E. refuses, must return to his father. They
separate, agreeing if they find L. to send him to E. (which they
do not do).</p>

share in adventure, tells A. he will find Kay at a hermitage.
When A. has ridden away sets K. free, and tells him to go to

G. follows, overtakes him at forester's house. It is Hector, who
is much grieved at what he has done. G. forgives him, and
they continue quest together. Third day (<b>1533</b>, <i>time not
mentioned</i>), come to ruined chapel and churchyard wherein is
marble tomb with inscription to effect that only the 'keytive'
knight who has failed through 'luxurien' to achieve adventure
of the Grail can fulfil this. Enter churchyard, find burning
tomb with twelve others round it, upright sword on each. G.
will test adventure, enters enclosure, is attacked by swords,
beaten to the ground, when he recovers consciousness is
outside. Tries again, with even worse result. H. also tries,
fails; letters appear on the door that none shall dare adventure
till the 'son of the dolorous queen' come.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> They leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
chapel and ride till they come to two roads by a cross on
which is written 'whoso takes left-hand road shall not escape
without much dishonour; of right-hand nothing shall be said
save that there is much danger.' H. insists on going to left
though G. would dissuade him. They separate.</p>

<p>Line 3535. <span class="smcap">Gawain</span> comes to pavilion where six knights are
at meat, he greets them, they make no response. G. seats
himself and begins to eat, they order him to stop, and on his
refusing attack him with swords and axes. G. slays one, cuts
off arm of another, rest flee. Rides away, comes to a valley
where he sees castle surrounded by deep water, goes towards
it. Hears cries from a tower, enters and finds maiden in bath
of boiling water (<b>1533</b>, <i>does not say water is boiling, and states
that she only expects aid from Lancelot</i>), prays him to lift her
out; he fails, she tells him he will not go hence without shame,
and that only 'the best knight in the world' can help her. G.
goes to castle, is well received. As they sit in the hall out of
the chamber whence the king came (<b>1533</b>, <i>he sees 'entrer parmi
une verriere'</i>) there comes a dove with censer in beak.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> All
are silent and kneel till dove has passed through hall and
entered a chamber. Then tables are prepared and all sit down
in silence. G. wonders much. Out of chamber where dove
entered comes the fairest maiden G. has ever seen, holding
above her head a vessel in the shape of a cup. The vessel
'ne was van houte ne van stene, ne van metale negene.' All
kneel as she passes, save G., and the tables are filled with the
best food on earth. When she has passed all but G. have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
been provided with food; he doubts if he has done amiss.
After the meal all leave the hall, doors are closed, and G. is
left alone. He lies down beneath a window. A man (dwarf?)
appears and tells G. to go into a chamber where none shall see
him, would strike him, but G. takes staff out of his hand, warns
him he shall not depart without dishonour. (<b>1533</b>, <i>G. is only
told 'fuyez vous en d'icy, vous n'y devez m'y estre, car en vous
a trop villaine chose.' G. sees bed through open door, and enters
chamber of own accord.</i>) G. goes into the chamber, sees a fair
bed and sits down upon it. Hears a voice warning him if he
sit unarmed on 't bedde van aventuren' he will surely die.
Arms himself; a sword (<b>1533</b>, <i>lance</i>) with fiery blade enters
room, smites him so sorely he cannot defend himself: becomes
unconscious, on recovery feels that blade is being drawn out
of his wound. Lies till daylight. (<b>1533</b>, <i>Quant il fut ennuyte
si que l'en y veoit mauvaisement fors que de la lune qui luysoit
a plus de quarante fenestres qui tout estoient ouvertes; lors
regarde monseigneur G. en une chambre qui estoit pres de lui.</i>)
Sees a great serpent enter the hall, making fearful noise, out of
its mouth come small serpents. Leopard attacks serpent,
fierce battle. When serpent finds it cannot slay leopard
returns to hall (chamber?), where the small serpents attack it.
They slay each other. A great wind rises, which sweeps hall
clean. G. hears women weeping, rises and sees twelve
maidens come weeping and kneel before door where dove
went in. They depart, and an armed knight comes and bids
G. go and rest on a bed in another chamber, he may no longer
stay here. G. refuses, they fight fiercely all day, at last fall
exhausted. It begins to thunder, the whole palace trembles,
G. is deafened by the sound, knows not if it be day or night
(<b>1533</b>, <i>if he be living or dead</i>). A great wind rises (<b>1533</b>, <i>soft and
sweet</i>), and he hears voices, two hundred at least, singing so
sweetly, nothing on earth can be like to it. He cannot understand
all the words, only 'Glorie ende lof moete hebben
ewelike die coninc van hemelrike.' The palace is filled with
a sweet smoke. Opens his eyes and sees the maiden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
evening before with vessel, preceded by two censers (<b>1533</b>, <i>and
two cierges</i>), places vessel on silver table, ten censers give
sweet smell around it. Voices sing 'Ere, bliscap, ende lof
moete hebben ewelike, Die soete here van hemelrike.' Maiden
carries vessel back to chamber. Hall grows dark and windows
fly open (<b>1533</b>, <i>and close again</i>). G. can see nothing, but feels
he is healed of his wounds, rises and looks for knight with
whom he had fought, but can find nothing. Hears people
enter and feels himself taken by hands and feet, bound, carried
out of hall, and laid on a cart. Daylight comes, he is still in
the cart, to which a wretched horse is harnessed; feels himself
shamed. A maiden (<b>1533</b>, <i>une vieille</i>) comes and drives the
horse out, as they pass the gateway the people mock at and
pelt G. When bridge is passed maiden looses his bonds and
tells him to leave the cart, he has been there long enough. G.
asks name of castle, it is Cambonoyc.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> He curses the day he
was born and made knight to be thus shamed. Rides all day,
at evening comes to hermitage, where he is kindly received.
Hermit asks his name, and is rejoiced at hearing it. Where
has he spent the night? G. will not say at first. (<b>1533</b>, <i>G.
shows shame at being praised. H. comforts him; no man
but knows misfortune. G. says no man has had such ill-luck
as he for fifteen days. H. asks how, and G. tells all.</i>) When
he does tell, H. keeps silence for a long time, then tells him he
has seen the Holy Grail, his own sin prevented him from being
fed by it. (<b>1533</b>, <i>quant vous ne luy feistes honeur bien vous

and go to fight a knight whom he cannot overcome; on his
return his own kinsmen shall fight against, and slay him. It
shall come about through G. himself. He must swear not to
reveal what H. has told him to any one. G. spends night
there, and in morning rides forth to seek Hector.</p>

<p>Line 4260. <span class="smcap">Hector</span> rides till eventide, meets a dwarf, who
warns him, but will give no explanation. H. rides on and
comes to a stone on which it is written, that no one enters
this land save to his shame. Then meets two maidens who
lament over him. Comes to a castle surrounded by water,
over which is a bridge. A maiden sitting under a tree greets
him kindly, and tells him there is a knight at the bridge who
jousts with all comers, and throws the vanquished into the
water. H. overthrows knight and crosses bridge. The gates
are closed, none may enter save by swearing to put an end to
the evil customs of the castle. H. swears and enters. Asks
what are the customs. There is an evil knight there who
fights with all who come; if victorious he drives them naked
through the streets; also he has dishonoured more than one
hundred (<b>1533</b>, <i>forty</i>) noble maidens. H. bids them lead him
to knight. They take him to a fair garden, well planted with
trees, in the midst of which is an open space. They show him
an ivory horn hanging on a tree, if he sound it the knight will
come.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> He does so and a 'hunch-backed and ugly' (<b>1533</b>,

his name. If he will swear to renounce evil customs H. will
tell him, not otherwise; knight prefers to fight. Folk tell
H. it was a ruse coming to him unarmed, had he made terms
and disarmed, he would have been overpowered at once.
Knight returns in red armour. After fierce fight H. slays him
and learns he must now deliver lady of the castle, who is in
a cave guarded by two leopards (<b>1533</b>, <i>lyons</i>). This he does;
slays leopards and releases lady, who is joyfully received by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the people. She is Argale van Grakenlant (<b>1533</b>, <i>Grindelain</i>),
and Lancelot's cousin. The knight was Margarij (<b>1533</b>,

the knight's horse? She knows Y. and his fame, and therefore
laughed for joy on meeting him. He consents and they ride
together. Knight comes out from his pavilion and demands
Y.'s horse. Y. will fight for it. They do so and the knight is
slain (<b>1533</b>, <i>apparently not, the lady only thinks he is dead</i>), and
his horse is given to maiden, who goes her way rejoicing. Y.

were unarmed; one was slain, the other fled. Dryas sent the

where three ladies are seated, one sixty years old, one forty,
one less than twenty; youngest very poorly dressed. G. asks
cause of her grief; her husband is very jealous because she
had praised Lancelot unduly, has taken away her rich clothes,
and forced her to eat with the servants. Oldest lady is in
woe because she has been forced to promise her daughter to
knight of low birth, who has murdered one wife already. Asks
G.'s advice. He tells her to keep her word, and he will free
the daughter. They go to castle together; knight arrives and
claims maiden, mother gives her up. As they ride off G. says

Beseeches maiden's love, but she refuses; she loves another,

but will at once seek castle of lady with jealous husband.
She receives him well; her husband is away, but returns
shortly, and though angry, allows G. to stay. Meanwhile
another knight arrives, Segramore. Husband, very wroth,
plots to slay them; but page overhears and tells lady, who

to meet each other. Dwarf tells them L. is well, was at
tourney lately (<b>1533</b>, <i>also gives news of intended tourney at
Kamalot</i>). They separate. Y. goes to an Abbey of White
Nuns, is healed of his wounds. Rides forth. Meets lady
thrashing a dwarf, bids her stop; she will, if Y. will do what
she wants; promises. He must kiss her; so ugly he hesitates.
She reproaches him; he is certainly not Y., she will go to
court and complain of him. Y. calls her back. She will let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
him off if he will fetch sword, shield, and helmet from tent
near by. Dwarf warns Y. she is most treacherous lady in
land. Y. will go. Rides with her, takes arms, leaving his own
in their place. Maidens rush out of tent weeping and tearing
their hair. He has dishonoured all maidens in the land, will
come to shame. Y. asks explanation. They will not answer;
he waits till evening, and as no one comes rides on to a
hermitage, where he is well received. H. asks if custom still
maintains that no man may sit at R. T. unless he be wounded.
Custom given up since Lancelot, Galehaut, and Hector were
admitted unwounded. Now each knight must vanquish one at
least in week following, or forfeit seat (<b>1533</b>, <i>must have done so
in preceding week</i>), (ll. 16770-875). Y. asks of shield; belongs
to a giant who had wasted the land, but for love of a maiden
had promised to remain in castle unless one did him shame.
After a year (<b>1533</b>, <i>longuement y avoit été</i>), becoming weary,
had sought chance of release, so had hung up shield, setting
twelve maidens to watch it (<b>1533</b>, <i>the people of the land had
set the watch</i>). Now he will be free, land wasted and maids
dishonoured. Y. rides on, bearing shield; all flee from him
(<b>1533</b>, <i>two maidens only</i>). Finds two maids by spring; they
bid him eat with them, does so. Knight comes up, would fight
with Y. for having released giant. Is overcome. Y. sends him
to giant to tell him who it is who has taken the shield. Knight
goes, giant strikes off his hand for tidings (<b>1533</b>, <i>giant gives
him his choice: he may lose his hand for the shield or his head
for the helmet</i>),<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and rides through land destroying and slaying
wherever he goes. Y. rides on, seeking shelter; no one will
have him. At one castle fights with father and son. Sleeps
under tree. Is wakened by sound of giant, who makes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
noise than twenty (<b>1533</b>, <i>twelve</i>) knights. Y. calls him, but he
is too angry to hear. Y. mounts and rides after him. Comes
to 'Castel van den Trepasse'; five (<b>1533</b>, <i>fifteen</i>) knights fall
upon him, kill his horse, and make him prisoner; will deliver
him to giant.</p>

would do well carefully to consider the meaning of such curious
inconsistency. If Chrétien were dealing with matter either of his own
invention, or of his own free adaptation, he would surely have been
more careful of the unities. If, on the other hand, he simply retold
tales belonging to different stages of Arthurian tradition, this is exactly
what we might expect to find.</p></div>

some of the other poems, <i>Galogres and Gawayne</i>, <i>The Carle of Carlile</i>,
<i>The Marriage of Sir Gawain</i>, and <i>Sir Libeaus Desconus</i> he is
mentioned, but plays no important part. The ballad of <i>Sir Lancelot

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Is it not possible that this <i>Malduz</i> the magician may be the
original of <i>Mauduiz li Sages</i> whom Chrétien ranks as eighth of
Arthur's knights? Cf. <i>Erec</i>, 1699. Hartmann's version gives Malduiz;
<i>Diu Krône</i>, 1379, Malduz der Weise. The identification seems
clear.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> I am quite at a loss to account for the mistake into which such
authorities as M. Gaston Paris and Professor Foerster have apparently
fallen. In M. Paris's study the idea that Lanzelet is the rescuer is
perhaps rather implied than stated, but when I wrote the <i>Charrette</i>
chapter (viii.) in my <i>Studies on the Legend of Sir Gawain</i>, in
which I followed the article in <i>Romania</i>, I was certainly under the
impression that the latter was the case. In the introduction to the
<i>Karrenritter</i>, p. xliv., Professor Foerster distinctly says that Lanzelet
frees the queen. I have read and re-read the text carefully and made
my final summary direct from it, and there is no doubt that Lanzelet
has nothing to do with the matter. The passage in question is contained
in ll. 6975-7445. How too did Professor Foerster come to
ignore the real character of Guinevere's imprisonment? Cf. <i>Charrette</i>,
lxxi.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> <i>Karrenritter</i>, Introduction, p. xliv.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> I think it is worthy of note that though Lanzelet is the hero of the
tale here and not Guinglain, Gawain's son, as elsewhere, yet in this
poem Lanzelet is Arthur's nephew, and of Gawain's kin, which he is
not in any other version. The <i>Fier Baiser</i> is thus still restricted to the
family of Gawain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> I say especially 'as told by Geoffrey and Wace,' for these writers
give us clearly to understand that the queen was a consenting party,
and no victim to Mordred's treachery. It is quite a different version
from that of the prose <i>Lancelot</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> I shall have occasion to refer very frequently to Professor Foerster's
introduction. It is a full and powerful statement of views which so
far as they affect the origin and evolution of the Arthurian legend I
believe to be radically unsound. It is most useful to have at hand a
summary so clear and concise.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> In the prose <i>Lancelot</i> the hero is always addressed as 'king's son.'
Cf. in this connection Professor Ker's review of my <i>Legend of Sir
Gawain</i>, Folk-lore, vol. ix. p. 266. I incline to think that the
question of a hero's possessing from the first a name and a
well-marked story depends upon whether he has or has not an existence
in <i>myth</i>. If of mythical origin he probably would have both, if an
actor in folk-tale very likely neither; thus while I should reject
Professor Ker's correction as regards <i>Gawain</i>, I would certainly hold
it true of <i>Lancelot</i>. In the case of this latter hero, I think his name
may well have been determined by his title du Lac. The tendency of
early verse is towards alliteration, probably mere chance determined
the <i>Lancelot</i>, the one essential was that it should begin with an <i>L</i>. It
should, I think, also be noted that while in the <i>Lanzelet</i> the hero's
ignorance of his name and birth are genuine, in the prose <i>Lancelot</i>
he knows who he is, and the wrong done to his father and uncle by
Claudas. The pseudonyms '<i>Filz du Roi</i>,' '<i>Beau Varlet</i>' are here unnecessary;
a meaningless survival from the original tale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> This feature is, I think, peculiar to Wolfram; Chrétien does not

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Professor Hertz, in his edition of the <i>Parzival</i>, p. 440, records these
points of contact, but does not discuss the question of the relation of
the two poems. Professor Foerster in his introduction simply notes
that the instruction by Johfrit de Liez recalls the <i>Perceval</i> story.</p></div>

demonstration of the correctness of the many curious Oriental references
with which the <i>Parzival</i> abounds, and his remarkable identification of
Wolfram's Grail with a sacred <i>Bætylus</i> stone, it is impossible any
longer to deny the possession, by Wolfram, of a source other than
Chrétien's poem. But whether the <i>Lanzelet</i> offers another proof or
not I should hesitate to say. If it does, the evidence, extending as it
does over so much of the <i>Parzival</i>, is of the greatest value as an indication
of the extent of Kiot's work.</p></div>

are perplexing. He prints Chrétien's description of the 'Ile' side by
side with a parallel passage from Giraldus Cambrensis, <i>Topographia
Hiberniæ</i>, informing us that both are 'ganz einfach eine naturgetreue
Beschreibung von Irland.' He cannot mean us to understand that the
one description is borrowed from the other; the work of Giraldus is at
least thirty years later than the <i>Erec</i> (<i>circa</i> 1186), and that chronicler
would hardly go to a romancer like Chrétien for the description of a
country he knew personally. But <i>is</i> it a '<i>Naturgetreue</i>' description
of Ireland at all? Professor Foerster is compelled himself to admit
naïvely, '<i>Gewitter und Stürme fehlen nicht ganz</i>!' Is this not rather
a description of the fabled Irish Paradise which Chrétien and Giraldus
alike have borrowed from a source common to both?</p></div>

of varying forms, <i>e.g.</i>, Whence did the continuators of Chrétien,
notably Gerbert, draw their versions? And what of the <i>Perceval</i>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> Professor Foerster's attempt to base an argument on the source
of <i>Cligés</i> cannot for a moment be accepted, cf. Introduction, <i>Charrette</i>,
cxxxviii. We only know that the source was a book; but what that
book contained, no one can say. We can never argue from the
<i>un</i>known to the known. We do not know much of Chrétien's sources
for the other poems, but the grounds for an investigation <i>do</i> exist in
the above instances, they do <i>not</i> in <i>Cligés</i>. We must find out how
Chrétien dealt with <i>Erec</i>, <i>Yvain</i>, and <i>Perceval</i> before we are in a
position to offer the slightest hypothesis as to his treatment of <i>Cligés</i>.
The fact that Mark of Rome gives a short summary of the story is
interesting, but so brief a <i>résumé</i> is of little critical value. It is
certainly not a <i>book</i>, therefore cannot possibly be identical with
Chrétien's source.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> On this subject, cf. any scientific collection of folk-tales, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>The
Science of Fairy Tales</i>, by Mr. E. S. Hartland, or in the same author's
<i>Legend of Perseus</i>, the tabulated variants of the Dragon story in
vol. iii. These would help the reader to realise the number of <i>motifs</i>
often combined in a single story. The <i>lais</i> of <i>Lanval</i>, <i>Graalent</i>, and
<i>Guingamor</i>, comparatively short though they be, yet combine at least
three distinct story-<i>motifs</i>, <i>i.e.</i> what we may call the Joseph and
Potiphar's wife, Tannhäuser, and Lohengrin themes. Any one of
these <i>lais</i> would be capable of considerable expansion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> I have studied the <i>Yvain</i> versions carefully, and have read those
of <i>Erec</i>, but not compared them critically; but I should not be surprised
if it were ultimately found that in <i>The Lady of the Fountain</i>
we have the story at a stage anterior to Chrétien, and probably that
at which it came into his hands, <i>redacted by the Welsh scribe under the
influence of Chrétien's poem</i>; while in <i>Geraint</i> we have the process reversed,
<i>i.e.</i> a rendering of <i>Chrétien's poem modified by the earlier version</i>.
In the statement, '<i>Gwiffert Petit he is called by the Franks, but the
Cymry call him the Little King</i>,' we have, I think, a hint of this. The
writer must have been too good a French scholar to think the one term
a translation of the other; it rather implies that the Welsh knew the
character only by a sobriquet borrowed from his diminutive size, which
is exactly what we should expect, the earlier stages of story-telling
being anonymous. So far as the correspondence in word and dialogue
is concerned, the conclusion to be drawn depends entirely on the nature
of the parallel passages; if they be merely such ordinary dialogue
(question and response) as would naturally spring from the incidents of
the story, both may well be reminiscences of the oral version. Analytic,
self-communing passages would, of course, point to a later stage in
evolution; but the Welsh version dialogue is of the simplest
description.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_97_97" id="Footnote_97_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> It is difficult to know exactly what value to place on the traditional
relationship of uncle and nephew as postulated of Arthur and
Lancelot in the poem of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven. This is so completely
a <i>lieu commun</i> of heroic romance. Except in the case of a hero of
distinctly mythical origin such as Gawain, I am inclined to consider
it as marking a secondary stage in the evolution of a hero, he would
have attained to a certain degree of popularity before it was postulated
of him&mdash;thus Perceval and Caradoc are each, in turn, Arthur's
nephews. In the case of Lancelot it probably represented an intermediate
stage between entire independence of Arthur (the original)
and son of a faithful ally (the final) form.</p></div>

appears to me to offer a very interesting parallel to the methods
employed by the compilers of the <i>Chansons de Geste</i>, which are
so ably pointed out by M. Leon Gautier in his <i>Epopées Françaises</i>.
The original story of the hero forms a nucleus from which other
romances depart in a downward direction&mdash;dealing with sons and,
perhaps, grandsons;&mdash;in an upward, dealing with father and grandfather&mdash;till
a complete cycle is thus formed. We have exactly
this process in <i>Lancelot</i>&mdash;the <i>Queste</i> extols the deeds of his son,
the <i>Merlin</i> those of his father; and we have indications that the
story was well on the way to the evolution of a secondary branch,
that of Bohort and his son. None of the other Arthurian heroes has
undergone a parallel development.</p></div>

here to remark that Professor Foerster apparently attributes considerable
importance to the pseudo-historical account of Arthur's
wars with the Saxons contained in the prose romances, notably
the Vulgate <i>Merlin</i> (cf. <i>Charrette</i>, p. xcvi., and review of <i>Legend
of Sir Gawain</i>, Zeitschrift für Franz. Sp., Band 20, p. 102), asserting
that the prose romances contain, side by side with the later,
the remains of the oldest stages of Arthurian tradition. To me it
seems patent that these romances have simply borrowed from the
<i>Chronicles</i>. There is nothing in them which cannot be found in Geoffrey
or his translators, and the fact that they represent the <i>romantic</i> legend
in a demonstrably late form, and not in one consonant with the
pseudo-historic indications, while there is no trace of any fundamental
revision of the story, such as might be expected, seems to make it
quite clear that they are of comparatively late invention. They by no
means stand on the same footing as do Wace and Layamon, which are
of distinct value in determining earlier forms of the legend. To take
one instance alone, the <i>Merlin</i> gives a long account of the sons of
King Lot, who play a most important part in the action of the
story, but the genuine early tradition gives Gawain no brother save
Mordred, and Layamon distinctly says, 'he wes Walwainnes broðer,
næs þer nan oðer' (ll. 25467-8). The existence of these sons marks a
secondary stage in the story; but they are in all the <i>prose</i> romances.
An exception should perhaps be made in favour of the Didot <i>Perceval</i>,
which gives the <i>Mort Artur</i> section in a form differing from the other
prose romances and much more closely in accord with the <i>Chronicles</i>.
I shall return to this point later on.</p></div>

version of the Arthurian tales has operated disastrously in confusing the
question. Not long ago a writer contributed to a review an article on
the subject, in which he contended for the essential identity of the
<i>Tristan</i> and <i>Lancelot</i> stories, naming among other parallels the fact
that in both cases the hero is sent to fetch home his lord's bride&mdash;an
addition due to Tennyson; Lancelot in the genuine story being unborn
at the date of the marriage. As regards the <i>Idylls</i>, it can only be said
that whereas Malory's juxtaposition of half a dozen different compilations
made confusion of a subject already more than sufficiently complex,
Tennyson's edifying rearrangement of Malory made that confusion
'worse confounded.' Malory is highly valuable for the Arthurian
legend in his proper place, when critically compared with other
versions; and has a separate and independent position as an English
classic. The <i>Idylls of the King</i> may perhaps also be considered an
English classic, but is <i>entirely</i> outside the range of critical Arthurian
scholarship, and should <i>never</i> be quoted as evidence for the smallest
tittle of Arthurian romance.</p></div>

abduction tale. The abductor <i>may</i> at one period have been Guinevere's
lover; but, as we now have it, the queen is the innocent victim of
violence. Further, it is evident that the abductor had ceased to be the
lover <i>before</i> the introduction of Lancelot into the story (cf. <i>Lanzelet</i>).
Therefore, if originally an infidelity story, we are met by the same

of this chapter had been sent to the press. The support afforded to
my theory by the above expression of opinion was most welcome to
me. A point which deserves notice in connection with this romance
is the appearance in it of the above-named <i>Briant des Illes</i>, and the
story of the death of <i>Lohot</i>, King Arthur's son. So far as I know, no
other prose romance knows either of these characters, but Chrétien
refers to both in his <i>Erec</i>, ll. 6730 and 1732. I think it is possible
that the name given by Wolfram von Eschenbach to Arthur's son,
<i>Ilinot</i>, may rest upon a misreading of <i>Lohot</i>; the story connected with
the latter is certainly curiously archaic in detail.</p></div>

presently by comparison of texts.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_150_150" id="Footnote_150_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> The worst fault of Dr. Wechssler's Grail study is that he predicates
the distinctive traits of Perceval as being of Galahad&mdash;to whom
they never in any sense belonged. Galahad is not Perceval's understudy,
much less is he his original: he is an absolutely and entirely
independent creation. The only quality they have in common is that
of virginity, which is not of them, but of the monkish redactors of the
legend. It is certainly no part of the primitive <i>Perceval</i> tale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_151_151" id="Footnote_151_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151_151"><span class="label">[151]</span></a> The passage which represents Gawain as admitting himself to be
the slayer of eighteen out of the twenty-two knights who have lost
their lives in the <i>Queste</i>, Baudemagus, his dearest friend according to
the <i>Merlin Suite</i>, among them, should, I think, be printed at the end
of the <i>Queste</i>, not at the beginning of the <i>Mort Artur</i>, where it is now
generally found. It is entirely in accordance with the tone of the
first named romance, and out of keeping with the latter. Moreover,
both the Dutch <i>Lancelot</i> and the 1533 version print it in the former
position. The compiler of the <i>Tristan</i> has generally been supposed
to be the first to introduce the vilification of Gawain's character; in
the light of Dr. Wechssler's suggestion it would be interesting to examine
whether this presentment is to be found in the <i>Tristan before</i>
its contamination with the later <i>Lancelot-Map</i> cycle. I think there
were peculiarities in the original Gawain story, which, misunderstood
by later compilers, helped to cast a false light on his character, but it
is open to question whether it was the <i>Tristan</i> compiler or the author
of the Galahad <i>Queste</i> who was the original propagator of calumny.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_152_152" id="Footnote_152_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_152"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> The <i>Queste</i> writer dwells upon instances of heroes betrayed through
their love of women&mdash;Samson, Solomon, etc. If he had known the
earlier <i>Lancelot-Borron</i> story, with the instance of Merlin's betrayal
by the lady who brought up Lancelot, he would surely have made
use of so very <i>à propos</i> an illustration.</p></div>

story&mdash;a version which, as we have seen, has certainly influenced the
<i>Lancelot</i> legend&mdash;the Grail-bearer, Repanse-de-Schoie eventually
becomes the mother of Prester John. The circumstance that the
details of the begetting of Galahad are found in the <i>Lancelot</i>, and not
in the <i>Queste</i>, suggests the consideration that the author of this latter
romance may have worked over the section of the <i>Lancelot</i> in question,
so as to bring it into superficial accord with his story. Or he <i>may</i>
have worked in conjunction with one of the later redactors.</p></div>

<i>Charrette</i>, for instance, had he known Bohort as represented in later
legend, he would certainly have made him, and not Gawain, undertake
the conflict with Meleagant, for which Lancelot threatens to be
too late. The role of 'helpful friend,' played by Gawain in the earlier
versions of the legend, is passed over to Bohort in the later.</p></div>

shake my belief in the soundness and reliability of foreign criticisms of

I assume throughout that Dr. Sommer's summary correctly represents
his text, but I admit that I have my doubts on this point; certainly
in the <i>Queste</i> section he gives some most mistaken readings; indeed,
apart from the evidence of <b>D. L.</b> and <b>1533</b> the whole <i>Lancelot-Queste</i>
section needs revision. It is unfortunate that some foreign scholars

<p><a name="Footnote_170_170" id="Footnote_170_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> Here I take the opportunity of saying that I entirely dissent from
Dr. Sommer's assertion that Gareth is the equivalent of the French
<i>Guerresches</i> rather than <i>Gaheret</i>. It is this latter (in the <b>D. L.</b> <i>Gariëtte</i>)
which <b>M.</b> renders by Gareth. I have paid a good deal of attention to
this question, and have come to the conclusion that, although in the
descriptive summary of King Lot's sons, found in the <i>Lancelot</i>,
Guerresches (Gurrehes) is said to be the youngest, save Mordred, and
Gawain's favourite, yet the adventures ascribed to Gaheret (variants,
Gaheriet, Gariëtte, Garhiës) throughout mark him as the original of
Gareth; a point which etymology alone would, I think, decide in
his favour! This much is certain, wherever <b>M.</b> and the French
versions can be compared we find Gaheret and <i>not</i> Guerresches.
When Dr. Sommer takes it upon himself, as he does in the quotations
from the French contained in the <i>Mort Artur</i> section, to
arbitrarily change the <i>Gaheret</i> of all the foreign versions into
<i>Guerresches</i>, because the latter agrees with his preconceived ideas, he
is setting what I must consider as a most undesirable precedent; we
cannot take these liberties with the texts and hope to arrive at a
satisfactory and scientific conclusion. As pointed out in my review of
Dr. Wechssler's Grail Study, once allow such a substitution, and
what is to prevent us from a series of editions emendated to suit the
personal views of each editor? I think myself that Gaheret and
Guerresches may originally have been one, but that confusion arose
from Mordred being sometimes considered as Lot's, sometimes as
Arthur's, son, and that a tradition of <i>four</i> sons of King Lot having
been established early in the evolution of the romantic story, the
personality of the third was doubled to make up the correct number.
This is only a suggestion, but there is certainly a confusion as to
identity in the French versions, though there is no confusion as to the
original of <b>M.</b></p></div>

here that in this instance the Grail is stated to be the dish out of which

Galahad <i>Queste</i>. The hero knows all about the Grail, its keeper,
where it is to be found, his own relation to it. He has grown up
under its shadow as it were. Nor need he fulfil any test to gain it:
in all the records of his adventures there is no temptation such as that
undergone by Perceval or Bohort; he is as fit to become keeper of the
Grail (for this and not Grail-<i>King</i> he practically becomes) when he
leaves Arthur's court as when he finally, after a series of aimless
adventures, arrives at Corbenic. Contrast this with the earlier versions:
the hero knows nothing of the Grail; not till after he has beheld the
Talisman and failed to accomplish the necessary test does he even
hear the name; when he would make amends for his negligence he
can no longer find the castle, and not till he has proved himself
worthy through long-continued trial is the opportunity once lost again
offered to him. Neither do the inhabitants of the Grail Castle know
their deliverer; they hope that it may be he, since they believe none
other might find the way, but they do not know him, whereas Galahad
is well known to the dwellers in Corbenic.</p></div>

Gawain to swear first, when Baudemagus interposes, saying that he
who is to achieve the quest should be the first to swear. Consequently
Galahad swears first, and is followed by Lancelot, Gawain, Perceval,
Bohort, Lionel and Hélie le Blank. Baudemagus is in no instance
the first to swear.</p></div>

in the Grail revelation, is a striking proof of the unreality of the
Galahad <i>Queste</i> quâ <i>quest</i>, on which I have remarked elsewhere. Who
are these knights? What claim have they to be admitted to a feast so
holy that even King Pelles and his son are excluded? Practically
they are as much achievers of the Quest as Galahad himself. The
fact is the writer is so taken up with the religious symbolism of the
relic that in exaggerating and insisting on symbolic details he loses
sight of the real point of his story. I very much doubt whether any
one but the Grail Winner himself ought to reach, or was ever contemplated
as reaching, the Grail Castle, much less be witness of the
full explanation of the relic. To this it may be objected that Gawain
reaches it; but Gawain was certainly at one time looked upon as the
Grail Winner, and I believe it is only in this character that he ever
found the castle. The accessibility of Corbenic is a <i>very</i> weak point
of the Galahad <i>Queste</i>.</p></div>

which he takes as part of the <i>Mort Artur</i>, refers to an earlier <i>Queste</i>
redaction. A <i>Queste</i> giving a full account of the fate of so many of the
knights engaged would be of portentous length, and there is absolutely
no sign of this Galahad <i>Queste</i> having existed in another form. I
regard it as a summing up, by the author, of the general results of the
expedition, a <i>postscriptum</i> which enabled him to have a final fling at
his <i>bête-noire</i> Gawain. The addition of Baudemagus's name may have
been his work, or that of a copyist, and designed to give point to his
accusation. Whether the tradition that he should be killed by Gawain
arose from this passage, or was incorporated in the <i>Merlin</i> from
another source we cannot say. The Baudemagus tradition demands
study. In the <i>Merlin</i> he is represented as but six years older than
Gawain, whose dearest friend he is, but in the <i>Charrette</i> he appears as
quite an old man, whose son, Meleagant, is the contemporary of Gawain
and Lancelot; while in the prose <i>Lancelot</i> and <i>Queste</i> he appears as
the devoted friend of the family of King Ban, sharing the adventures
of these young knights on an equal footing. The whole presentment
is hopelessly confused. The frequent reference to the Arthurian records,
as kept in the 'almeryes' at Salisbury, appears to me to be a parallel
case to the allusions in the Charlemagne Romances to the records at
S. Denys. I suspect there is as much, or as little, truth in the one
ascription as in the other.</p></div>

simply dogmatising in an unwarrantable manner on a question with
regard to which he has no <i>locus standi</i>. Exaggerated as the statement

of Professor Foerster's own hypotheses.</p></div>

introduced.</p></div>

<i>Lancelot</i> is that which offers the most important variants, and is the
most likely to reward the careful critic. The final section is practically
based upon a romance foreign to the original <i>Lancelot</i> story, and which
has been incorporated into it; consequently we may expect to find all
the versions in pretty general agreement as regards the <i>Mort Artur</i>
proper.</p></div>

the prototype of Gareth; also, subsequent study has shown me that,
outside the <i>Lancelot</i> proper and the romances which have been
modified for cyclic purposes, we rarely find any mention of Guerresches,
whereas we often meet with Gariët. I am strongly of opinion that
originally the two characters were one, and that in that earlier form
the knight was Gaheriet or Gariët.</p></div>

that Bohort fights against Ywain; to this Dr. Sommer appends a note
of exclamation, and a footnote to the effect that Ywain has already
been killed by Gawain, as related in the <i>Queste</i>. Of course it was
not the '<i>Chevalier au Lion</i>,' but his bastard half-brother, '<i>Yvain li
avoutres</i>,' who was slain on that occasion. The text of <b>Q.</b> is quite
clear.</p></div>

We are told that King Karados assists at the council between Arthur,
Lancelot, and Gawain, when the fight is determined upon. Dr.
Sommer reminds us in a note that Karados had been previously slain
by Lancelot! That was, of course, the giant of that name, brother to
Turquine; <i>this</i> is the famous Karados '<i>Brief-bras</i>,' sometimes regarded
as Arthur's nephew. Dr. Sommer's apparent lack of familiarity with
the minor characters of the Arthurian cycle is inexplicable.</p></div>

<b>M. A.</b> make mention of <i>Baudemagus</i> as one of Lancelot's councillors,
whereas at the end of the <i>Queste</i> his death at the hand of Gawain is
recorded. Cf. this with my remarks on the Baudemagus legend,
p. 184. I do not think this story of his death was a genuine part of
the cyclic <i>Lancelot</i>, but belonged to another line of tradition known
to the author of <b>Q.</b> from the Merlin <i>Suite</i>, and unintelligently quoted
by him. This, which is a real discrepancy, as there is but one
Baudemagus, Dr. Sommer does not remark upon!</p></div>

great extent, carried out with the most painstaking perseverance,
yet because he omitted to consult such accessible texts as the Dutch

unanimity of the printed versions, a very important section of his work
is largely deprived of value, and urgently requires revision.</p></div>

to which I have referred earlier. It is mentioned both in
<i>G. S. Graal</i> and <i>Queste</i>. The wording here is not very clear, but it
does not, I think, mean that Lancelot has already failed in the Grail
adventure, but that he shall come to the cemetery after he <i>has</i> failed;
which is fulfilled in <i>Queste</i>. At the same time we must remember that
in <i>Perceval li Gallois</i>, which knows nothing of Galahad or the <i>Queste</i>,
Lancelot fails for the same reason, and more completely, as the Grail
does not appear at all in his presence, so this <i>may</i> refer to the earlier
story.</p></div>

in no way due to any defect of <i>character</i>, but to his omission of the

ignorant. This explanation appears to me to be peculiar to the

Gawain with great respect.</p></div>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been corrected, but other variations
in spelling, punctuation, and the use of accents
have been retained except where in conflict with the index.</p>

<p> A missing "the" was added in chapter 8. "In these last instances the
story may well have been in the <i>Lancelot</i>, and taken over by "the"
compiler of <i>Grand S. Graal</i>; the <i>Queste</i> makes very little of them;
